## Current Data Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**:
   - src/scripts/download_publicpay_csv.js Workforce CSV from publicpay.ca.gov
   - src/scripts/download_budgets.sh Budget PDF from ebudget.ca.gov
   - src/scripts/download_vendor_transactions.js vendor CSV from fiscal.ca.gov

2. **Data Processing**:
   - src/scripts/extract_pdf_text.py extract text from budget PDF files
   - src/scripts/process_vendors.ts process vendor CSV for vendor json records
   - src/scripts/process_department_spending.js process budget text for fund, program, and department json records
   - src/scripts/process_department_salary.js process salary CSV for department json record salary and headcount fields
   - markdown files are created by AI prompt using the budget text files using 2015 - 2025 fiscal years

3. **Data Sources**:
   - ebudget for department, fund, and program json
   - fiscal for vendor json
