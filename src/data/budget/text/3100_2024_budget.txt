3100   Exposition Park 
The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are 
located in Exposition Park, a 152-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these 
three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park. 
The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park 
usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of 
the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, preserve, 
and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the 
western United States. 
Because the Science Center's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Science Center has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER 
 
Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and 
family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops 
and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 
Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological 
processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering, 
communications, and transportation, on land and in space. Construction for the Science Center’s Air and Space Center, the 
permanent home for the Space Shuttle Endeavour, began in March 2022 and is expected to be completed in spring 2025. 
In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The 
Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and 
other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a 
Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The 
school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 
The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those 
traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding 
support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation. 
2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT 
The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management 
and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events, 
and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is 
responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of 
park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park 
Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in 
addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood. 
2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM 
The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the 
Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of 
African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African 
American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear 
campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility 
in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public 
programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture, 
historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and 
to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at 
large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty 
years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an 
inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.
