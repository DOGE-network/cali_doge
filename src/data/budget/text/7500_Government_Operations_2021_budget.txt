MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Statewide Open Access Middle-Mile Broadband Network—The Budget includes $3.25 billion one-time Coronavirus Fiscal 
Recovery Fund to fund the oversight, implementation, and maintenance of a statewide open access middle-mile broadband

effectiveness of state entities. 
• Security Operations Center and Audit Program—The Budget includes $21 million General Fund for 49.0 existing Office of 
Information Security positions previously funded via the Technology Services Revolving Fund. The change in funding will 
sustain the Audit Program’s standard four-year audit cycle without cost recovery ramifications to effected state entities and

internal management and operational efforts to enhance their security infrastructure.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6280 - TAX PROGRAMS 
This program administers the Revenue and Taxation Code by reasonably interpreting and impartially applying the legislatively 
enacted laws that provide a significant portion of General Fund revenue. The Franchise Tax Board is responsible for 
administering the personal income tax and the corporation tax. Tax program activities include taxpayer assistance and tax 
return processing, filing enforcement, audits, and tax collection functions. The program also includes the collection and 
distribution of voluntary contributions to, and on behalf of, certain non-profit charitable organizations. 
6285 - POLITICAL REFORM AUDIT 
 
This program determines the accuracy and completeness of political statements and reports filed with the Secretary of State, 
and compliance with disclosures and record keeping requirements. On behalf of the Fair Political Practices Commission 
(FPPC), and in compliance with the Political Reform Act of 1974, the Franchise Tax Board conducts field audits of state and 
local candidates, measures committees, lobbying entities, committees supporting and opposing political candidates and 
statewide measures. These entities are randomly selected by the FPPC and/or meet dollar thresholds. 
6290 - DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES COLLECTIONS PROGRAM 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent motor vehicle license fees, taxes, and penalties on behalf of

7760   Department of General Services 
The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides 
centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and 
construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building; 
printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's 
vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve 
California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions. 
Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES 
With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for 
inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in 
public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds 
are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public 
building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school 
districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e) 
Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California. 
6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and 
equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties. 
6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES 
 
Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid 
redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate 
space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring  protection of lives and 
property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified 
parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their 
programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies, 
and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and 
ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners. 
6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES 
 
To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are 
essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and 
leveraged procurement agreements for information technology and non-information technology goods and services, green and 
sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing 
small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing 
the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include 
travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy 
efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and human resources services. 
Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct quasi-judicial hearings 
and mediations authorized by law. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This 
program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services, 
auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative 
services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, information technology, health and safety, and 
departmental procurement and contracting.

7870   California Victim Compensation Board 
The governing body of the California Victim Compensation Board (CalVCB) consists of three members: the Secretary of the 
Government Operations Agency who serves as the chair, the State Controller, and a public member appointed by the

imprisonment. 
• Process claims for the Missing Children Reward Program to assist local law enforcement agencies or other parties involved 
in the identification and recovery of missing children in California. 
• Process claims through the Good Samaritan Program to private citizens who are injured rescuing another person, preventing 
a crime, or assisting a law enforcement officer.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Restitution Fund Backfill—The Budget includes $33 million General Fund in 2021-22, and $39.5 million annually thereafter, 
to backfill the decline in revenues in the Restitution Fund. This funding will enable the Victim Compensation Board to 
continue providing vital compensation payments to victims. 
• Reparations for Victims of Forced Sterilization—The Budget includes $7.5 million one-time General Fund to establish the 
Forced or Involuntary Sterilization Compensation Program to provide compensation for individuals who were sterilized 
pursuant to eugenics laws between 1909 and 1979, or sterilized while imprisoned after 1979.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer 
financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a 
claim with the CalVCB for program benefits. 
6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM 
This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery 
of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community 
(the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition 
and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 
the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities. 
6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN PROGRAM 
This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that 
benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $1.9 billion Proposition 2 debt repayment funding for a supplemental pension payment in 2021-22 to 
further reduce the state’s CalPERS unfunded liability. This is a supplemental payment in addition to the estimated $6 billion 
contribution the state is statutorily-required to make to CalPERS in 2021-22. Based on current projections, an additional $5.5 
billion in Proposition 2 funding is planned to be paid to CalPERS over the remaining forecast period (fiscal years 2022-23 to 
2024-25) depending on the future availability of those funds. 
• Although not reflected in 7900 - Public Employees' Retirement System, the Budget includes $225 million within the 
Proposition 2 debt repayment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s portion of a loan from the Surplus Money 
Investment Fund. This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension payment towards the CalPERS state retirement 
plans in 2017-18.

5/ The 2021 Budget Act estimates 2021-22 other expenditures to be $1,030,261,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of 
Administration at its April 2021 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2021-22 Governor's Budget to the 2021 Budget 
Act is primarily due to an increase in investment external management fees and third party adminstrator fees.
1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2021-22 Governor's Budget.
2/ This display does not reflect the $1.9 billion supplemental pension payment to the California Public Employees' Retirement 
System (CalPERS) in 2021-22 towards the unfunded liabilities of the state retirement plans that are included in the 2021 Budget 
Act, nor does it reflect the supplemental pension payments to the CalPERS state plans and Schools Pool that are included in 
the 2019 Budget Act. Chapter 33, Statutes of 2019 (SB 90) authorized a $3 billion supplemental pension payment to be paid to 
CalPERS over fiscal years 2018-19 through 2022-23, and Chapter 859, Statutes of 2019 (AB 118) authorized a $100 million 
supplemental pension payment to be paid to CalPERS over fiscal years 2019-20 through 2022-23. The following changes were 
implemented as part of the Budget Act of 2020: (1) remove the General Fund payments scheduled over fiscal years 2020-21 
through 2022-23, (2) pay the scheduled $243 million 2020-21 General Fund payment to the state patrol member plan using 
Proposition 2 debt repayment funding, and (3) redirect the $2.5 billion transferred in 2019 to produce the most immediate 
savings (over fiscal years 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22).
3/ The 2021 Budget Act estimates 2021-22 state contributions to CalPERS to be $6,039,662,000. The decrease in this estimate 
from the 2021-22 Governor's Budget to the 2021 Budget Act reflects a slight decrease in the state plans' employer contribution 
rate, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2021 meeting.
4/ The 2021 Budget Act estimates 2021-22 administrative expenditures to be $433,175,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board 
of Administration at its April 2021 meeting. The decrease to this estimate from the 2021-22 Governor's Budget to the 2021 
Budget Act reflects the net of the savings approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its November 2020 meeting 
and anticipated increases in salary and benefits captured in the expenditures approved in April 2021.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6410 - RETIREMENT 
CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for 
employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of 
duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2020, there were about 1,320,000 active and inactive members, and 
about 733,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 
Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. 
There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter, 
California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract 
with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit 
formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions. 
As of June 30, 2020, there were 2,890 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and 
survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their 
careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency 
retirement systems. 
CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 
6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY 
CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the 
federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age, 
Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.  As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the 
liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.  The program is responsible for 
administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting 
and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 
6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 
The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee 
associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees, 
retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs, 
provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer 
representatives. 
Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic, 
Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all 
eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial 
intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 
6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 
Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the 
purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired 
members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees' 
Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $395.8 billion, as of June 30, 2020. 
6425 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of 
the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy 
Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term 
Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

7910   Office of Administrative Law 
The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state 
regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these 
regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also 
responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been 
recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through 
a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members 
of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 
In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies 
constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 
The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the 
California Regulatory Notice Register.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $12.3 million for 30 positions and funding for external investment audit services to continue building 
inhouse investment capabilities and the benefits of internally managed assets, and manage overall growth of assets under 
management. The funding and positions in 2021-22 represent the first year of a multi-year strategy for these efforts in the 
amount of $40.9 million and 109 positions, distributed across fiscal years 2021–22 through 2025–26. 
• The Budget includes $3.9 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The roughly $435 million increase from the 
previous fiscal year is largely due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its authority to 
increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law in 2014. See 
6300 - State Contribution to the State Teachers' Retirement System for more information. 
• The Budget includes a $410 million supplemental pension payment in 2021-22 towards the state's share of the Defined 
Benefit Program's unfunded liability to be paid out of Proposition 2 debt funding. See 6300 - State Contribution to the State 
Teachers' Retirement System for more information.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS 
CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the 
distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the 
largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement 
benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may 
modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the 
member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's 
retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or 
contract provisions. 
Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the 
General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of 
administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
