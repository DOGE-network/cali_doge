probation, and managing the Diversion Program for licensees whose practice may be impaired due to abuse of dangerous

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
1111    Department of Consumer Affairs
 
The Department of Consumer Affairs (Department) is responsible for promoting and protecting the interests of millions of
California consumers by serving as a guardian and advocate for their health, safety, and economic well-being and by
promoting legal and ethical standards of professional conduct.  The Department helps to promote good business practices
and to ensure that California's consumers receive quality services by establishing minimal competency standards for
approximately 250 classifications involving approximately three million professionals.  The Department is also an important
advocate on consumer and business issues.  In general, the Department's Boards and Bureaus provide exams and
licensing, enforcement, complaint resolution, and education for consumers. 
 
In addition, centralized services are provided by the Department for efficiency.  Specifically, Department staff investigate
complaints against licensees; develop valid examinations for applicants for licensure; monitor and advocate for legislation;
provide consumer education and outreach; provide legal and audit services; and provide general administrative support
involving personnel, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, and space management. 
 
Effective Fiscal Year 2016-17, the Department is no longer separated into two business units, and is now displayed under
one business unit, 1111. 
 
There are currently 26 boards, two committees, and one commission under the broad authority of the Department, and nine
bureaus and one certification program under the direct oversight of the Department. 
 
Additional information on the Department, and the various boards and bureaus, is available at www.dca.ca.gov.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
1660 - CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM 
 
The objective of this program is to protect the public's health, safety, and general welfare in buildings and structures
designed for human occupancy through the enforcement of the California Health and Safety Code, including the State
Housing Law, Employee Housing Act, Mobilehome Parks Act, Special Occupancy Parks Act, California Factory-Built
Housing Law, and the Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act of 1980. HCD works with factory and site-built building
industries, stakeholders, and other government agencies to review, amend, and recommend incorporation of model building
codes for conventional construction into California's building standards. The program also enforces federal and state
standards for the construction, safety, sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars. 
 
1665 - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) increase housing supply by providing loans and grants to develop and preserve
safe and affordable housing for lower-income households, (2) promote economic, community, and job development by
awarding state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and
(4) monitor funding recipients for compliance with the terms of their contracts with the state. The program also promotes
economic and job development through administration of the federal Community Development Block Grant Program, and is
responsible for the state Enterprise Zone Program wind-down. 
 
1670 - HOUSING POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) facilitate an adequate supply of housing affordable to all income groups through
the development, promotion, and implementation of housing and community development policies, practices, and
partnerships, (2) provide oversight for local housing plans, (3) administer planning and incentive grant programs, and (4)
collect and analyze data to evaluate and communicate progress in meeting HCD goals and outcomes. 
 
1675 - CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY 
 
The objective of CalHFA's lending activity is to finance housing at affordable interest rates using lending models that
facilitate: (1) mortgage loans to qualified low and moderate income homebuyers to finance the purchase of an affordable
home, (2) permanent loans to create and preserve multifamily housing projects, and (3) special needs housing loans to
facilitate the construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing needed to serve special needs populations.  CalHFA also
administers the California Housing Loan Insurance Fund activity, which encourages the preservation of existing housing and
improves new housing opportunities by offering mortgage insurance products to homebuyers who might not qualify for
traditional lending programs. 
 
1680 - LOAN REPAYMENTS PROGRAM 
 
This program displays the estimated loan repayments made under HCD's Financial Assistance Program. 
 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM 
 
This program provides: (1) executive leadership in designing, implementing, and communicating housing programs and
policies, (2) fiduciary oversight and fiscal management through its audit, accounting, and budget functions, (3) development,
review, and implementation of legislation related to HCD programs, (4) housing-specific legal expertise, and (5) support
services in the areas of personnel, information technology, business services, and contract management.
