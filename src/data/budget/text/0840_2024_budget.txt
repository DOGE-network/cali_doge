0840   State Controller 
The State Controller is the chief fiscal officer of California. Principally responsible for transparency and accountability of the 
state's financial resources, the Controller ensures the appropriate disbursement and tracking of taxpayer dollars. The Controller 
serves on dozens of state boards, commissions, and committees with duties ranging from administrative oversight of the 
nation's two largest public pension funds, to protection of state lands and coastlines, to modernization and financing of major 
infrastructure. The Controller also offers fiscal guidance to local governments and has independent auditing authority over 
government agencies related to the spending of state funds. The Controller's primary objectives are to: 
• Account for and control disbursement of all state funds, issuing warrants in payment of the state's bills. 
• Determine legality and accuracy of financial claims against the state. 
• Audit state and local government programs and agencies. 
• Ensure businesses report and remit unclaimed property in compliance with Unclaimed Property Law and safeguard remitted 
unclaimed property until claimed by the rightful owners or heirs. 
• Inform the public of the state's financial condition. 
• Inform the public of financial transactions of city, county, and other local governments. 
• Administer the Uniform State Payroll System. 
• Audit and process all personnel and payroll transactions for state civil service, state exempt employees, California State 
University employees, and Judicial Council employees.

2024-25 GOVERNOR'S BUDGET — LJE 2
0840   State Controller - Continued
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
0500100 - ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING 
The State Accounting and Reporting Division maintains uniform and systematic control accounts of all receipts, payments, 
appropriations, state fund balances, and bonded indebtedness; monitors the cash flow of the General Fund; administers the 
statewide discharge from accountability program; participates in offsetting monies owed to the state; reports the financial 
condition of the state; and collaborates with the Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, and the Department of General 
Services to develop and implement the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal) to ensure the system meets the 
state's primary objectives and provides best business practices for the state. 
The Local Government Programs and Services Division maintains a database of information and reports on local financial 
transactions and government compensation; apportions shared revenues to local governments; administers local mandated 
and non-mandated cost reimbursement programs; approves county cost allocation plans; prescribes uniform accounting 
procedures for counties, special districts, and trial court revenues; plans and facilitates an annual conference with county 
auditors; administers and collects estate and inheritance taxes; collects delinquent insurance and motor vehicle fuel taxes, 
petroleum and gas assessments, and trial court penalties; refunds gasoline taxes paid on fuel consumed for off-highway 
purposes; instructs and advises county tax collectors; approves state and local government requests to participate in the 
Interagency Intercept Collection Program; collects recorder fees from counties pursuant to the Building Homes and Jobs Act, 
(Chapter 364, Statutes of 2017); and administers the Property Tax Postponement Program for seniors and people who are 
blind or have a disability. 
0500200 - AUDITS 
The Audits Division determines the legality and accuracy of all claims against the state through the performance of prepayment 
audits; assures the accuracy of local government claims and financial statements submitted to the state and federal 
governments by establishing and updating audit guidelines, and reviewing audits performed by independent auditors; performs 
field audits for state and federal programs; reviews the single audit reports of local governments and local education agencies 
that receive pass-through federal funds from state agencies; and audits major businesses for compliance with the Unclaimed 
Property Law. 
0500300 - PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL SERVICES 
 
The Personnel and Payroll Services Division (PPSD) processes payroll and leave accounting for all state civil service and 
exempt employees, state court, and California State University employees. PPSD provides information required to manage the 
personnel resources of the state and to properly account for salary and wage expenditures, provides data to the retirement 
systems necessary for calculation of employee retirement benefits, and manages the state’s automated travel expense 
reimbursement system. 
Cal Employee Connect (CEC) and ConnectHR are SCO’s secure web-based customer service portals for state employees and 
human resources staff, respectively. They were developed as interim solutions to provide some of the enhancements the 
California State Payroll System Project (CSPS) will deliver when completed, to support a hybrid remote workforce and make 
personnel and payroll transactions more efficient and paperless. 
The CSPS Project was initiated to modernize the statewide human resource management, travel and business expense, and 
payroll systems as part of a fully integrated solution. The system should enable the state to improve management processes 
and fulfill its payroll, reporting, and deduction processing obligations accurately and on time. 
0500400 - UNCLAIMED PROPERTY 
 
The Unclaimed Property Division administers the Unclaimed Property Law by providing one central source for rightful owners to 
claim their property; notifying owners of their unclaimed property before it is transferred to the state; receiving unclaimed 
property from banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, and other businesses; and providing outreach and education for 
businesses holding unclaimed property. 
0500500 - DISBURSEMENTS 
The Disbursements Bureau produces and distributes all payments of the state's obligations after auditing and clearance 
through control accounts.  Examples of some of the state's payments are personal income tax refunds, payroll, vendor 
payments, in-home supportive services and retirement payments. Disbursements also provides post-issuance services, 
including disposition of undeliverable warrants, lost warrant duplication, processing of claims of forgery, and maintenance and 
production of paid warrant images. 
0500900 - DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive Office and Administration functions include Budgets, Business Services, Contracts and Procurement, 
Departmental Accounting, and Human Resources all of which provide executive direction and support services to all divisions 
within SCO.
