and operation of 31 adult institutions, 3 of which have reception centers, and 35 conservation camps. The Chuckawalla Valley 
State Prison closed on November 30, 2024. The program is responsible for improving institution programming and operations. 
This program is also responsible for providing facility maintenance, asset management, and construction services for CDCR's 
adult facilities and other closed properties. In addition, the Office of Correctional Safety facilitates institution and public safety 
via security threat group management, escapee apprehension, major criminal investigations, and critical incident response 
training. 
4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION 
The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and 
degree of successful reintegration of incarcerated individuals released from state prison into the community. The program is 
responsible for providing direct supervision and Global Positioning System (GPS) surveillance of the state’s supervised 
population. It is also responsible for the location and apprehension of supervised persons who have absconded or when certain 
case factors exist. The Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies utilize the California Parole Supervision and 
Reintegration Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices to elicit long-term behavioral changes to reduce recidivism. 
Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the incarcerated 
person's risk factors and current mental health needs. Case Supervision level, reassessment, and reclassification are regularly 
scheduled based on the supervised person's behavior and stability in the community. Other components of supervision include 
the Sex Offender Management Program, which incorporates the containment model strategy and GPS monitoring for all sex 
offenders as required by statute. 
Another integral aspect of this program is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and 
services in each prison and includes the identification of the supervised person's needs to match them with state and local 
programs to support successful transition from incarceration to the community.

have served a certain amount of time based on the sentence; incarcerated persons sentenced to life with the possibility of 
parole for a nonviolent offense under an alternative sentencing scheme, such as the state’s Three Strikes Law, once they have 
served a certain amount of time based on their commitment offense; incarcerated persons who were under the age of 26 at the 
time of their offense, and have served a minimum of 15, 20, or 25 years of continuous incarceration, depending on the 
sentence, or under the age of 18 if sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, and are eligible for a Youth Offender 
Parole hearing; and incarcerated persons eligible for the Elderly Parole Program. 
The Board conducts medical parole hearings and hearings for certain parole violators. Additionally, the Board administratively 
reviews certain determinately-sentenced persons who are convicted of nonviolent offenses for possible release, approves 
transfers of foreign citizens who are incarcerated in California to their native countries where they are to serve the remainder of 
their sentence, and determines whether certain individuals should be discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for 
offenders with mental health disorders and sexually violent predators, and subsequent hearing referrals are made to the 
Department of State Hospitals for mental health treatment. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board investigates 
applications and forwards recommendations for pardons, reprieves and commutations of sentence, and extends such services 
to those involving the death penalty. The Board also has the discretion to recommend to the court that an incarcerated person’s 
sentence be recalled and that they be resentenced.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
As one of the largest departments in state government, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) operates 31 
state-owned institutions, 34 firefighting and conservation camps, and 1 local justice-involved youth camp. CDCR's 
infrastructure includes more than 41 million square feet of state-owned building space on more than 21,000 acres of land (33 
square miles) statewide. 
CDCR and the Board of State and Community Corrections jointly administer several programs to partially finance the design 
and construction of county correctional facilities. The programs consist of Adult Local Criminal Justice and Local Youth 
Offender Rehabilitation facilities. Legislation is comprised of the 2007 Senate Bill 81 (Youth), the 2007 Assembly Bill 900 
(Adult), the 2012 Senate Bill 1022 (Adult), the 2014 Senate Bill 863 (Adult), and the 2016 Senate Bill 844 (Adult). 
Approximately $294 million has been awarded to 19 counties to build or remodel Youth Offender facilities and approximately 
$2.137 billion has been awarded to 53 counties to build or remodel Adult Local Criminal Justice facilities. CDCR oversees 42 of 
these projects totaling approximately $1.616 billion authorized from Assembly Bill 900, Senate Bill 81, and Senate Bill 1022.

5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and technical 
assistance necessary to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships within California's adult and juvenile criminal 
justice systems, and to promote legal and safe conditions for youth, the incarcerated, and staff in local detention facilities. This 
mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, intervention, suppression, 
and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with the integrated 
statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for managing 
criminal justice populations. The Board seeks to ensure that its efforts are systematically informed by experts and stakeholders 
with subject matter expertise. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation jointly 
administer several programs to partially finance the design and construction of county correctional facilities. The programs 
consist of Adult Local Criminal Justice and Local Youth Offender Rehabilitation facilities. Legislation is comprised of the 2007 
Senate Bill 81 (Youth), the 2007 Assembly Bill 900 (Adult), the 2012 Senate Bill 1022 (Adult), the 2014 Senate Bill 863 (Adult), 
and the 2016 Senate Bill 844 (Adult). Approximately $294 million has been awarded to 19 counties to build or remodel Youth 
Offender facilities and approximately $2.137 billion has been awarded to 53 counties to build or remodel Adult Local Criminal 
Justice facilities. BSCC oversees 29 of these projects totaling approximately $918 million authorized from Senate Bill 1022, 
Senate Bill 863, and Senate Bill 844.

The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 
in a manner similar to private industry. CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or their designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or their designee, the 
Secretary of the California State Transportation Agency or their designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker of the 
Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the Governor

representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of CDCR or their designee serves as chair of the Board. 
 
CALPIA supports CDCR’s public safety mission by providing rehabilitative job training programs to incarcerated individuals. 
These programs provide opportunities for incarcerated individuals to learn vocational skills, establish good work habits, and 
obtain career training so they can gain meaningful and productive employment and be successful when they return to their 
communities. CALPIA's primary goals are rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. 
CALPIA has three statutory objectives: (1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 
provide work opportunities for incarcerated individuals under the jurisdiction of CDCR; (2) create and maintain working 
conditions within enterprises similar to those that prevail in private industry to provide incarcerated individuals assigned therein 
the opportunity to work productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 
(3) operate work programs for incarcerated individuals that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from 
the sale of products and services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by CDCR. 
CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
