The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design
and construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable
of providing sustained services to the public. 
 
3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE 
 
The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and
nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors
the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By
facilitating access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout
California. 
 
3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS

approximately 6,000 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and
treatment data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an
ambulatory surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care
providers, health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media.

and families through: 
 
Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives.
Opportunities for community involvement.
Support to family members providing care and.
Collaboration with other state and local agencies.
 
As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that
provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and
Advocacy Program.  The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs:  it contracts directly with agencies that
operate the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies
Community-Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid. 
 
The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging.  At
the local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults,
adults with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
3890 - NUTRITION 
 
The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally-balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60
years of age or older.  In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the
isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and
assistance, employment, and education. 
 
3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 
 
The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time
subsidized training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older.  The
program also promotes transition to unsubsidized employment. 
 
3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 
 
This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers,
grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities.  Services include information and
assistance, legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and
the Long-Term Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access
the support necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive
long-term care services appropriate to their needs. 
 
3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 
 
This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP).  HICAP
provides personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries.  HICAP is the
primary local source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans,
and health plans. 
 
3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 
 
This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult
Services (CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age
or over who are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or
disabilities. The Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program.  Under a 1915(c) Medicaid
home and community-based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and
unnecessary long-term care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing
facility.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Current Year Shortfall - The Budget includes increased expenditures in the Medi-Cal program of approximately $1.1
billion General Fund compared to the 2016 Budget Act. The current year increase is primarily attributable to a one-time
retroactive payment of drug rebates to the federal government and miscalculation of costs associated with the
Coordinated Care Initiative in prior estimates.
 
Coordinated Care Initiative - Under the Coordinated Care Initiative (CCI) Cal MediConnect program, persons eligible for
both Medicare and Medi-Cal (dual eligibles) receive medical, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and
home and community-based services coordinated through a single health plan. Under current law, if the CCI
demonstration project is not cost effective, the program automatically ceases operation in the following fiscal year. The
Governor's Budget estimate of the CCI projects that it will no longer be cost-effective. Therefore, consistent with current
law, the Budget Act assumes the program will be discontinued in 2017-18.  Based on the lessons learned from the CCI
demonstration project, the Budget Act includes the extension of the Cal MediConnect duals demonstration pilot  for an
additional two years, through December 31, 2019. The Budget Act reflects savings of approximately $8.5 million
General Fund.
 
General Fund Share for Medi-Cal Optional Expansion - Beginning in 2018, the state assumes a 6-percent share of cost
for the optional expansion population. The Budget includes costs of $14.9 billion ($1.5 billion General Fund) in 2017-18
for this population.
 
Proposition 56 - The Budget includes $711.2 million to support new growth in Medi-Cal for expenditures as compared
to the 2016 Budget Act and $546 million for supplemental provider payments for physician services, dental services,
women's health, Intermediate Care Facilities for the Developmentally Disabled, and HIV/AIDS waiver providers. The

4260    Department of Health Care Services - Continued
$546 million in supplemental provider payments are subject to federal approval, and contingent on continued stability in
federal Medicaid funding.
 
Restoration of Medi-Cal Dental Benefit - The Budget includes $34.7 million in 2017-18 and $72.9 million General Fund
annually thereafter to restore full dental services for adult beneficiaries in the Medi-Cal program, effective January 1,
2018.
 
Restoration of Medi-Cal Vision Benefit - The Budget includes statutory changes to restore optometric and optical
services for adult beneficiaries in the Medi-Cal program, effective January 1, 2020, contingent on the Legislature
including funding for these services in the state budget process.
 
Diabetes Prevention Program - The Budget includes $38,000 in 2017-18 and approximately $5 million General Fund in
2018-19 and annually thereafter to implement a Diabetes Prevention Program as a covered Medi-Cal benefit.
 
Medically Tailored Meals Pilot Program - The Budget includes $2 million General Fund annually for three years
beginning in 2017-18 to implement a three-year pilot program to provide medically tailored meals for specified Medi-Cal
beneficiaries.
 
Skilled Nursing Facility Staffing Ratios - The Budget includes an increase in the minimum number of direct care
services hours in skilled nursing facilities from 3.2 to 3.5 hours per patient day, effective July 1, 2018.  It also specifies
that a minimum of 2.4 hours per patient day must be provided by certified nurse assistants.  This change allows for
waivers of the direct care service hour requirements when there is a shortage of available and appropriate health care
professionals.  This results in estimated costs of approximately $10.4 million General Fund in the Medi-Cal program
starting in 2018-19.
 
California Children's Services Medical Therapy Program - The Budget includes $1.6 million General Fund for non-
medically necessary occupational therapy and physical therapy services. Recent court decisions have required the
provision of these services if included in a child's written Individualized Education Program, even when they are not
deemed medically necessary.  These services are not eligible for federal financial participation.  The Administration will
continue to work with the Legislature to resolve this issue.
 
Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund Abolishment - The Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund funded expenses related to
the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program (MRMIP), which was originally established as a state high-risk pool.  The
ACA has reduced the need for the high-risk pool because individuals cannot be denied coverage based on a pre-
existing health condition.  The Budget abolishes this Fund, and transfers the remaining fund balance to the newly
established Health Care Services Plan Fines and Penalties Fund to fund MRMIP and the Medi-Cal program.
 
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization - To extend the CHIP program beyond September 2017,
Congress must pass legislation. Given the uncertainties around what actions Congress may take, the Budget assumes
the program is reauthorized but at the non-enhanced federal matching percentage of 65% effective October 1, 2017,
and includes General Fund costs of $396.9 million
 
Managed Care Organization Tax - Chapter 2, Statutes of 2016, Second Extraordinary Session (SBx2 2), authorized a
tax on the enrollment of Medi-Cal managed care plans and commercial health plans, which is in compliance with
federal Medicaid regulations. This tax funds the nonfederal share of Medi-Cal managed care rates for health care
services provided to children, adults, seniors and persons with disabilities, and persons eligible for both Medi-Cal and
Medicare. The Budget Act reduces General Fund spending in the Medi-Cal program by approximately $1.2 billion in
2016-17 and $1.8 billion in 2017-18.
 
Hospital Quality Assurance Fee Extension - On November 8, 2016, voters passed Proposition 52, which amends the
state Constitution to permanently extend the existing Hospital Quality Assurance Fee as defined under Chapter 27,
Statutes of 2016 (AB 1607) . Under prior law, the fee was due to sunset on December 31, 2017. The Budget Act
assumes General Fund savings of over $1 billion in 2017-18 from the hospital fee. 
 
AB 85 Redirection of County Savings - Chapter 24, Statutes of 2013 (AB 85), modified the 1991 Realignment Local
Revenue Health Account distributions to capture and redirect savings counties are experiencing from the
implementation of federal health care reform. County savings are estimated to be $585.9 million 2016-17 and $688.8
million in 2017-18. The Budget also includes an adjustment of $255.6 million to account for actual county savings
based on the reconciliation of the 2014-15 fiscal year. The Budget assumes reimbursement of this amount from the
counties in 2017-18. The General Fund savings are reflected in the CalWORKS program within the Department of
Social Services' budget.  
 
Drug Medi Cal Organized Delivery System Pilot-The Budget includes $124.4 million General Fund for a five-year pilot
program for participating counties to use an organized delivery system to provide substance use disorder services to
eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries. A total of 7 counties began providing services in 2016 17 and an additional 9 counties
are anticipated to begin providing services in 2017 18.
 
Performance Outcomes System - The Budget includes $6.2 million General Fund for the implementation of functional
assessment tools for populations receiving specialty mental health services through county mental health plans. These
assessment tools will gather data from both a clinician?s and caregiver?s perspective and will be used to track
outcomes for Medi Cal mental health services provided to children up to age 21.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
4140 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM 
 
Through the network of regional centers, the Department supports the development and maintenance of services for eligible
persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers directly provide or coordinate the
following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis, (3) counseling, (4) lifelong
individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the individual program plan,
(6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of legal, civil, and service
rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning, placement, and
monitoring for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, (12)
community education about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services. The needs of individuals who reside in
state-operated facilities are assessed and community resources are developed to assist those who can appropriately
transition to the community. 
 
The Department monitors regional centers to ensure they operate in accordance with statute, regulations, and their contract
with the Department. 
 
4145 - DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS PROGRAM 
 
The Department operates three developmental centers: Fairview (Orange County), Porterville (Tulare County), and Sonoma
(Sonoma County). Secure treatment services are provided at Porterville Developmental Center.  In addition, the Department
leases one small community facility for persons who require specialized behavioral interventions: Canyon Springs, a 63-bed
facility in Cathedral City.  The developmental centers are licensed as General Acute Care Hospitals with distinct parts for
skilled nursing care and intermediate care.  Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility only.  Services at all
facilities involve the provision of active treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis, including
appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, assistance with activities of daily living, training,
education, and employment. 
 
The primary objectives of the Developmental Centers Program include providing care, treatment, and habilitation services to
residents based upon assessed need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan.  These services are offered
in the most efficient, effective, and least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the
judicial system; and are designed to teach individuals skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or
improvement of health and welfare, and enhance personal competence in all areas of daily living. 
 
The Developmental Centers Division provides central administrative and clinical management services to the three
developmental centers and the leased small community facility to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with
state licensing and federal certification requirements, protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility
structures and grounds. Areas of responsibility include the development of policy and procedures for all aspects of the
developmental centers operations, law enforcement and protective services, facility population management, program and
fiscal oversight, and facilities planning and support. 
 
The Department has initiated closure planning for the remaining developmental centers.  Sonoma Developmental Center is
scheduled to close by the end of 2018, with Fairview Developmental Center and the non-secure treatment portion of
Porterville Developmental Center planned for closure by 2021. 
 
4150 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM 
 
This program provides legal support for the Department through an interagency agreement with the Department of Justice. 
 
9900 - DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION 
 
The objective of this program is to provide to the Department (1) overall management, planning and policy development,
legal, legislative, audit, and administrative services, and (2) revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state
programs, insurance companies, and private payers for the cost of services.

The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission
is to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, seeking innovation and excellence in state hospital
operations, across a continuum of care and settings. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of
mental health treatment of its patients. In 2015-16, State Hospitals served approximately 13,000 patients and the average
daily inpatient census was approximately 7,000 in a 24 hours a day/7 days a week hospital setting. Additionally,
approximately 625 individuals received community outpatient treatment through the conditional release program. 
 
The Department oversees five state hospitals and three psychiatric programs located in state prisons. The five state
hospitals are Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan - Los Angeles, Napa and Patton. The three psychiatric programs are
currently operated through a memorandum of understanding with the California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation, and treat inmates in Vacaville, Salinas Valley and Stockton.  The Budget reflects the transfer of responsibility
for the psychiatric programs to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation beginning in 2017-18.    
 
The Department also provides services in jail-based competency treatment programs and conditional release programs
serving all 58 counties. 
 
Because the Department of State Hospitals' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure
Overview."

4440    Department of State Hospitals - Continued
Offender Commitment Program, the Restoration of Competency Program, and the treatment and evaluation of judicially and
civilly committed patients. 
 
Program Administration 
 
Program Administration includes headquarters functions that support the state hospital system, including policy development
and management, licensing oversight, patients' rights coordination, clinical oversight, data research and fiscal management. 
 
In-Patient Services 
 
The state hospital system includes five state hospitals: Atascadero, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, Patton, and Coalinga.
In addition, this program includes three inpatient psychiatric programs located at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville,
Salinas Valley State Prison in Salinas Valley and within the California Health Care Facility in Stockton. The three psychiatric
programs provide treatment services to CDCR inmates and the responsibility for these facilities is proposed to be transferred
to CDCR beginning in 2017-18. Mental health treatment services at all facilities are delivered by clinical teams who provide
full-time inpatient care to the most serious mentally ill and those incapable of living in the community. 
 
Conditional Release 
 
The Conditional Release Program (CONREP) is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic
patients. Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began
operations on January 1, 1986. 
 
The goal of CONREP is to provide greater public protection in California communities via a standardized community
outpatient treatment system. 
 
Restoration of Competency/Jail-Based Competence Treatment 
 
The Restoration of Competency (ROC)/Jail-Based Competency Treatment (JBCT) Program focuses on defendants deemed
Incompetent to Stand Trial in accordance with Penal Code Section 1370. The ROC/JBCT Program provides mental health
treatment to defendants in a jail-based or community setting, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in
court proceedings. 
 
4385 - FORENSIC EVALUATION SERVICES 
 
Forensic Evaluation Services is comprised of the Mentally Disordered Offender (MDO) and the Sex Offender Commitment
Program (SOCP). The MDO program applies only to prisoners whose crimes were committed on or after January 1, 1986.
Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets six specific criteria be ordered by the Board of Prison
Terms to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter
793, Statutes of 1995) was enacted  January 1, 1996, establishing  a new category of civil commitment for persons found,
upon release from prison, to be sexually violent predators (SVP). The SOCP administers clinical screenings to determine
whether an individual is likely to be a SVP and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the Department. 
 
4390 - LEGAL SERVICES 
 
The Legal Services Division is responsible for providing a full range of comprehensive legal services including, but not
limited to: developing legislation; providing litigation; protecting the confidentiality and privacy of patient information under
the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act; providing contract law advice to the state hospitals, psychiatric
programs and headquarters; and representing the Department at various court and administrative law proceedings involving
involuntary medication, orders to show cause, and personnel actions statewide.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES 
 
The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities
through vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state.  In addition, the
Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (education, mental health, and welfare) to provide
services to consumers.  The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process, which gives priority to
persons with the most significant disabilities. 
 
Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range
of services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, and
independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their communities. 
 
The Department provides comprehensive training and supervision to enable persons who are blind or visually impaired to
support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias.  Prevocational services are provided by
the Orientation Center for the Blind to newly blind adults to prepare them for vocational rehabilitation services and
independent living. 
 
The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational
rehabilitation services for the Department's consumers.  The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation
Programs, and establishes fees for services provided to its consumers. 
 
The Department works with the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Department of Labor to administer the Promoting the Readiness of Minors in
Supplemental Security Income grant to develop and implement model demonstration projects that promote positive
outcomes for children who receive Supplemental Security Income and their families to improve the provision and
coordination of services and supports for child SSI recipients and their families. 
 
4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES 
 
The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located
throughout California.  Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live
independently and be productive in their communities.  Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling,
benefits advocacy, independent living skills development, housing assistance, personal assistance services, transition
services to community based living, transition services to postsecondary life for youth, and personal and systems change
advocacy. 
 
The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program.  In coordination with consumers and
their families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons
with TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, and vocational supportive services. 
 
The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 22 non-profit community-
based organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist
visually impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities.  Core services
consist of low vision training, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills,
independent living skills development, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services. 
 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
 
The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support
services to departmental programs.

4250 - STATE COUNCIL SERVICES 
 
The State Independent Living Council, in conjunction with the Department of Rehabilitation, is responsible for developing a
state plan for independent living and for monitoring, reviewing and evaluating the implementation of that plan.  The Council
also interacts with similar statewide councils to enhance the effectiveness of the network of centers that provide independent
living services in California.  The Council is required by the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, in order for the
state to receive financial assistance for Independent Living Services and the Centers for Independent Living.  The Council
serves as an educational resource on disability and independent living for the Governor, other state agencies, the
Legislature, the general public, and a variety of statewide and national organizations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
4260 - 4260 CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM 
The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing
parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and
enforcing those orders.  The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title
IV-D child support program in California.  Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant. 
 
4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION: 
The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and
operating expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support
agencies. The federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration
costs. 
 
4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION: 
Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal
certification.  There are two components of the statewide system, the Child Support Enforcement system and the State
Disbursement Unit.  The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer
accounts, and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments.  The Child
Support Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated disbursement unit, which collects child support
payments from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties.  In addition, the Child Support
Automation program provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
IHSS County Mitigation - The Budget includes $400 million General Fund in 2017-18 to mitigate the increase in
counties' costs for the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program associated with the end of the Coordinated Care
Initiative.  The amount of General Fund relief provided to counties will be phased down over time, decreasing to $330
million in 2018-19, $200 million in 2019-20, and $150 million annually thereafter.
 
IHSS Administration - The Budget includes a one-time increase of $37 million General Fund for county IHSS
administrative costs in 2017-18.  The Administration will work with the California State Association of Counties and the
County Welfare Directors Association of California to examine the workload and budget assumptions related to IHSS
administration.
 
IHSS Overtime Exemptions - The Budget includes $1.9 million General Fund in 2017-18 to reflect increased costs
associated with overtime exemptions for IHSS providers. This funding will support state reviews of denied exemption
requests independent of a county's determination, the periodic assessment of recipients who may be eligible for
provider overtime exemptions, and costs for one-time notification to providers and recipients of the overtime exemption
request and approval process.
 
CalWORKs Single Allocation - The Budget provides a one-time augmentation of $108.9 million in 2017-18 to the single
allocation for counties.  The Administration will work with representatives of counties and the County Welfare Directors
Association of California to develop recommendations for revising the single allocation budgeting methodology to
address the cyclical nature of caseload changes and impacts to county services.
 
Online CalWORKs Appraisal Tool Integration - The Budget includes $3.7 million General Fund in 2017-18 to
commence integration of the Online CalWORKs Appraisal Tool into the Statewide Automated Welfare System.
 
CalWORKs Outcomes and Accountability Review Act - The Budget includes $600,000 General Fund in 2017-18 to fund
initial efforts to establish the CalWORKs Outcomes and Accountability Review, which will create a local accountability
system with the goal of improved program outcomes.
 
Housing and Disability Advocacy Program - The Budget includes one-time funding of $45 million General Fund for a
county matching grant program designed to provide outreach to homeless persons with disabilities who may be eligible
for disability benefits programs.
 
Immigration Services - The Budget includes $45 million General Fund in 2017-18 to expand the availability of legal
services for people seeking naturalization services, deportation defense, or assistance in securing other immigration
services and remedies.  Funding will be evaluated on an annual basis.
 
Child Care Bridge for Youth in Foster Care - The Budget includes $15.5 million General Fund in 2017-18 and $31
million General Fund annually thereafter to assist foster care providers in securing short-term child care services.  
 
Schools with High Refugee Enrollment - The Budget includes one-time funding of $10 million Proposition 98 General
Fund to provide additional services to school districts with high refugee populations.
 
CalFood Program - The Budget provides $8 million General Fund in 2017-18 and $6 million General Fund annually
thereafter for the CalFood program, which provides emergency food and funding to food banks.  Funding will be
evaluated on an annual basis.
 
Safe Drinking Water Pilot Program - The Budget includes one-time funding of $5 million General Fund, available
through July 1, 2020, for a Safe Drinking Water Supplemental Benefit pilot program to provide time-limited benefits to
residents served by public water systems that fail to meet safe drinking water standards. 
 
Homelessness and Low-Income Displacement Natural Disaster Assistance - The Budget includes one-time funding of
$5.4 million General Fund to assist homeless and low-income individuals in the City of San Jose displaced by the
Coyote Creek flooding that occurred in February 2016.
 
Poverello House Food Bank Investment - The Budget includes one-time funding of $1 million General Fund for the
Poverello House in Fresno County to develop a new food storage facility.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS 
 
The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support
themselves.  These programs are comprised of five components: 
California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)
Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food
Assistance Programs
Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program
County Administration and Automation Projects
Disaster Relief
 
The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to
enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to
monitor, administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services. 
 
4270010 - CalWORKs: 
The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
CalWORKs is California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary
assistance to meet basic needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal
responsibility.  CalWORKs includes specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child
care, to enable an individual to meet these requirements.  Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage
system to current and former CalWORKs recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain
conditions).  Stage One is administered by the Department of Social Services.   Stages Two and Three are administered by
the California Department of Education.  Parents have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care
homes, or license-exempt providers.  CalWORKs families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the
work force and engaging children in child care and development services. 
 
4270019 - Other Assistance Payments: 
The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term
residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian
as a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation.  This
program is administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department
of Social Services as authorized by federal and state law.  The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support
payments to relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system. 
 
The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate
the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care.  This program is administered by the counties
in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by
federal and state law. 
 
California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs: 
 
The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States
provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.
 
The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care,
and independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States
unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of
the minor.
 
The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of
human trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements.  Benefits
are available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under
CalWORKs).
 
The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of

nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of
purchasing food.  The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations
eligible to receive federal benefits.  Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal
benefits due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance
Program.  The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to
participate in employment and training activities. 
 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for
distribution to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons.  The food is distributed to eligible
recipients for household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings.  This program is also
supplemented with food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer
contributions generated through a state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by
farmers and businesses. 
 
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious
supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age.  Administrative responsibility for the Commodity
Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social
Services on October 1, 2016. 
 
4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program: 
The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or
disabled persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements.  California supplements the federal SSI
payment with a State Supplementary Payment (SSP).  The SSI/SSP program is administered by the Federal Social Security
Administration who determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients. 
 
4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects: 
Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff
who administer public assistance programs. 
 
Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services. 
 
4270046 - Disaster Relief: 
The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have
suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private
assistance programs. 
 
4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING 
 
The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include
child welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs.  The department is responsible for development of policy,
regulations, and procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring
and evaluation of the service delivery system. 
 
4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services: 
The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely
in their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care.  Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled
individuals who either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements.  There
are four programs that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community
First Choice Option, and IHSS-Residual Program. 
 
4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing: 
The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse
Prevention. 
 
Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement
and prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children.  The services are provided through an integrated
services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with
the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and
least restrictive home-like setting.  Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated
from foster care.  The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff. 
 
In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter
773, Statutes of 2015.  The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to
change out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment
and case planning. 
 
The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and
private adoption agencies in the state.  Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for
children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court.  Services
include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive
parents; training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country
adoptions.  For independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the
court when the biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice.

The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and
sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and
services for at risk families and their children. 
 
The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of physical and financial abuse and
neglect or exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary. 
 
The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health
and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care.  The program includes
facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components. 
 
4275028 - Special Programs: 
The Special Programs provides funds for Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance, Access Assistance to the
Deaf, Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services and Legal Services for Unaccompanied and
Undocumented Minors. 
 
4280 - TITLE IV-E WAIVER 
 
The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California.  This project
provides participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state
foster care maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable. 
 
4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES 
 
The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and
provide administrative services to other agencies. 
 
4285010 - Disability Evaluation: 
The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents
applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid)
of the Social Security Act.  Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s)
and overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. 
 
4285019 - Services to Other Agencies: 
In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative
services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human
Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public
information services. 
 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
 
The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and
administrative support services to other departmental programs.

5195    State-Local Realignment, 1991
 
In the 1991-92 fiscal year, State-Local Program Realignment restructured the state-county partnership by giving counties
increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs.  This realignment
provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

Estimated Revenues and Expenditures
 
5195    State-Local Realignment, 1991 - Continued
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT 
 
The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve
improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity.  Realignment provides for greater funding
stability for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to
encourage cost-effective approaches to providing services. 
 
Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.
Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts.  Funds deposited in these accounts
are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs
specified in realignment legislation.  The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in
order to ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment.  This
provision ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars
annually for county health and social services programs.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
5196    2011 State-Local Realignment
 
Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a
dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility. 
 
Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare
services, and adult protective services.  Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties.
Therefore, it is appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state
maintaining an oversight and technical assistance role where needed.  These changes are made with the goal of providing
services more efficiently and at less cost. 
 
The funding sources for realignment are: 
 
The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax.
The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues.
 
Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts:
