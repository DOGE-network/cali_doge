PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6280 - TAX PROGRAMS 
This program administers the Revenue and Taxation Code by reasonably interpreting and impartially applying the legislatively 
enacted laws that provide a significant portion of General Fund revenue. The Franchise Tax Board is responsible for 
administering the personal income tax and the corporation tax. Tax program activities include taxpayer assistance and tax

distribution of voluntary contributions to, and on behalf of, certain non-profit charitable organizations. 
6285 - POLITICAL REFORM AUDIT 
 
This program determines the accuracy and completeness of political statements and reports filed with the Secretary of State, 
and compliance with disclosures and record keeping requirements. On behalf of the Fair Political Practices Commission 
(FPPC), and in compliance with the Political Reform Act of 1974, the Franchise Tax Board conducts field audits of state and 
local candidates, measures committees, lobbying entities, committees supporting and opposing political candidates and 
statewide measures. These entities are randomly selected by the FPPC and/or meet dollar thresholds. 
6290 - DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES COLLECTIONS PROGRAM 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent motor vehicle license fees, taxes, and penalties on behalf of 
the Department of Motor Vehicles by utilizing the same collection capabilities that are used to collect the personal income tax. 
6295 - COURT COLLECTION PROGRAM 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent fines, penalties, and orders imposed by, and on behalf of, 
superior, municipal, and justice courts by utilizing the same automated collection capabilities that are used to collect the 
personal income tax. 
6300 - LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM 
This program reimburses the Department of Justice for legal services provided in support of Franchise Tax Board functions. 
6305 - CONTRACT WORK

governmental entities, and delinquent debt collection services.

This program provides executive leadership under the general direction of the Franchise Tax Board by directing departmental 
operations, developing and executing policies, making decisions concerning program operations, and ensuring that the Board's 
programs and services are carried out in accordance with Government Code sections 15701 and 15702. This program also

7760   Department of General Services 
The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides 
centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and 
construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building; 
printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's 
vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve 
California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions. 
Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

2019-20 STATE BUDGET — GOP 51
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for 
inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in 
public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds 
are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public 
building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school 
districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e) 
Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California. 
6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and 
equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties. 
6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES 
 
Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid 
redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate 
space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring  protection of lives and 
property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified 
parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their 
programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies, 
and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and 
ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners. 
6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES 
 
To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are 
essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and 
leveraged procurement agreements for information technology and non-information technology goods and services, green and 
sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing 
small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing 
the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include 
travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy 
efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and human resources services. 
Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct quasi-judicial hearings 
and mediations authorized by law. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This 
program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services, 
auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative 
services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, information technology, health and safety, and 
departmental procurement and contracting.

7870   California Victim Compensation Board 
The governing body of the California Victim Compensation Board (CalVCB) consists of three members: the Secretary of the 
Government Operations Agency who serves as the chair, the State Controller, and a public member appointed by the 
Governor. CalVCB provides responsive financial compensation to remedy the financial burdens of victims of crime through a

• Determine the eligibility of individuals for compensation for pecuniary injury sustained through erroneous conviction and 
imprisonment. 
• Process claims for the Missing Children Reward Program to assist local law enforcement agencies or other parties involved 
in the identification and recovery of missing children in California. 
• Process claims through the Good Samaritan Program to private citizens who are injured rescuing another person, preventing 
a crime, or assisting a law enforcement officer.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer 
financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a 
claim with the CalVCB for program benefits. 
6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM 
This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery 
of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community 
(the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition 
and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 
the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities. 
6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN PROGRAM 
This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that 
benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 
DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY 
Government Code, Title 2, Division 5, Parts 3, 4, and 5; and California Constitution, Article XVI, Section 17. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes an estimated $6.8 billion contribution ($3.9 billion General Fund) to the CalPERS state retirement plans, 
as required by statute.  The $569 million estimated increase ($328 million General Fund) from the previous fiscal year is due 
to (1) the normal progression of the existing amortization and smoothing policy, (2) the CalPERS Board's action in 2016 to 
lower the assumed rate of return for the system, and (3) increases in payroll. The assumption change increased the system's 
liabilities, resulting in an increase to the state's funding obligation. The reduction in the assumed rate of return, from 7.5 to 7 
percent, is being phased in over three years; this is the third and final year of the phase-in. 
• The Budget includes $2.5 billion General Fund in 2018-19, as the first installment of a $3.0 billion payment to be paid

towards the unfunded liabilities of the CalPERS state retirement plans in fiscal years 2018-19, 2020-21, 2021-22, and 
2022-23. This is a supplemental payment in addition to the estimated $6.2 billion contribution that the state is statutorily-
required to make to CalPERS in 2018-19. 
• The Budget includes a $904 million General Fund payment in 2018-19 to be paid to the CalPERS Schools Pool. Of this 
amount, roughly $244 million will supplant school employer contributions to the CalPERS Schools Pool over the next two 
fiscal years, reducing the contribution rate by 1.012 percent in 2019-20 and by 0.70 percent in 2020-21. The remaining $660 
million will be paid towards the unfunded liability for the CalPERS Schools Pool. 
• Although not reflected in 7900 - Public Employees' Retirement System, the Budget includes $390 million within the 
Proposition 2 debt repayment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s portion of a loan from the Surplus Money 
Investment Fund authorized in Chapter 50, Statutes of 2017 (SB 84). This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental 
pension payment towards the CalPERS state retirement plans in 2017-18. 
• The Budget brings the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Revolving Fund (OASI Fund) under the budget-approval process to 
ensure administrative oversight and provide better insight and transparency into the State Social Security Administrator 
program and OASI Fund.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6410 - RETIREMENT 
CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for 
employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of 
duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2018, there were about 1,263,000 active and inactive members, and 
about 695,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 
Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. 
There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter, 
California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract 
with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit 
formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions. 
As of June 30, 2018, there were 2,892 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and 
survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their 
careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency 
retirement systems. 
CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 
6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY 
CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the 
federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age, 
Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.  As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the 
liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.  The program is responsible for 
administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting 
and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 
6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 
The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee 
associations, and others to provide health and long-term care insurance for state, California State University, and local public 
agency employees, retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-
effective programs, provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee 
organizations and employer representatives. 
Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic, 
Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all 
eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial 
intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 
6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 
Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the 
purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired 
members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees' 
Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $358.0 billion, as of June 30, 2018. 
6425 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of 
the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy 
Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Operational 
Support, and Public Affairs.

7910   Office of Administrative Law 
The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state 
regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these 
regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also 
responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been 
recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through 
a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members 
of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 
In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies 
constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 
The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the 
California Regulatory Notice Register.

7920   State Teachers' Retirement System 
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution 
plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred 
compensation plans and programs: 
• State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP) 
• CalSTRS Pension2 Program (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans) 
• Teachers' Health Benefits Fund 
• Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund 
CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school 
teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of 
June 30, 2018, there are approximately 949,000 members, retirees, and beneficiaries of the STRP Defined Benefit Program. 
CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement 
Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

Education Code, Title 1, Division 1, Part 13. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $3.3 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The roughly $241 million increase from 
the previous fiscal year is due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its authority to 
increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law in 2014. 
• The Budget includes $4.0 million and 7 positions for enterprise compliance, litigation, and investment engagement activities. 
In addition, this will provide funding for external auditors to perform an annual independent audit of CalSTRS financial 
statements. These resources will enable CalSTRS to strategically manage operational, financial, legal, and reputational risks 
of the organization. 
• Although not reflected in 7920 - State Teachers' Retirement System, the Budget includes a $2.25 billion supplemental 
pension payment to CalSTRS in 2018-19 on behalf of school employers, and a $2.9 billion supplemental pension payment 
spread over four years to be paid towards the state's share of the unfunded liability for the CalSTRS Defined Benefit 
Program. See 6300 - State Contribution to the State Teachers' Retirement System for more information.

1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2019-20 Governor's Budget.
3/ The 2019 Budget Act reflects 2019-20 state contributions to CalSTRS to be $3,323,223,000.  The increase in this amount from the 2019-
20 Governor's Budget to the 2019 Budget Act is due to an increase in reported creditable compensation.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS 
CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the 
distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the 
largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement 
benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may 
modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the 
member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's 
retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or 
contract provisions. 
Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the 
General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of 
administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
