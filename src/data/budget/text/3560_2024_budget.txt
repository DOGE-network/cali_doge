3560   State Lands Commission 
The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its 
care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access. 
Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars in 
revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources. 
Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands 
Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign 
public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal 
government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands 
legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These trust grants encourage responsible development, 
environmental preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law 
Public Trust Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the 
trust to the benefit of all Californians. 
Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and 
lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high 
water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands, 
which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California. 
School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the 
five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state 
ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest 
in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands. 
Because the State Lands Commission’s (SLC) programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, SLC has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the SLC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Mineral Resources Management Division oversees the efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands. 
The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the 
safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas, 
geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public 
safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources 
through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also implements various programs for the prevention of oil 
spills and the safe operation of offshore facilities and conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives 
fair value for the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the 
oil and gas facilities under its jurisdiction. 
Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-
generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects. The Commission also coordinates with other agencies to 
administer the statewide Abandoned Mines Program. 
2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural 
and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public 
Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from Lake 
Tahoe and the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast in the west, and include California’s 
two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin. 
The Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California Legislature to approximately 70 local 
jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including the state’s five major ports. The 
Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for use or development, preserving 
and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands. 
Finally, the Commission manages the state’s school lands, which seeks to develop and consolidate the state’s school-land 
holdings to the economic benefit of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. 
2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION 
The Marine Environmental Protection Division regulates marine oil terminals within California, providing the best achievable 
protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Division monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, 
inspects all marine facilities, and reviews and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification 
programs. The Division also administers Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit

for their purpose, and implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous 
species into California waters through the operations of oceangoing vessels. The program funds and conducts scientific 
research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing 
vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions. 
9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction, and administrative support to the 
Commission’s line programs.

Northern California and two in Southern California. Of the five facilities, one is state-owned (Huntington Beach Field Office), 
and the other four are in leased space.
