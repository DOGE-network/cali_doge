administrative oversight, and support for the overall success of all adult and juvenile correctional and rehabilitation programs. 
The program consists of the Office of the Secretary; Legislative Affairs; Public and Employee Communications; Internal Affairs; 
Audits and Court Compliance; Victim and Survivor Rights and Services; Support Services; Enterprise Information Services; 
Labor Relations, Regulations and Policy; Research; Legal Affairs; Leasing and Facility Management; Appeals; and the Office of 
the Ombudsman. 
4505 - PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT 
The Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development program is responsible for planning, organizing, analyzing, and 
managing peace officer selection through the recruitment, application, testing, background investigation, and medical/
psychological screening processes. The program is also responsible for academy training and employee development for all 
departmental staff. 
4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES 
The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services

4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS 
The Department accepts commitments from California courts when the person to be committed meets age requirements, can 
materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there are adequate facilities available to care for the individual. 
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and 
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility 
operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, incarcerated youth intake and court services, population 
management services, facility maintenance, and maintains incarcerated youth master files. This program currently oversees 
operations for three facilities and one conservation camp. 
Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 
release planning for each incarcerated youth. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based 
treatment programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption 
therapy, sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp 
programs, and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior 
and reduce recidivism and relapse. 
This program will ramp down operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on June 
30, 2023 pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92). 
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the

knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release. 
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State 
Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education, 
English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for 
work experience. 
This program will ramp down operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on June 
30, 2023 pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92). 
4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES

for overseeing and implementing the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model, which uses evidence-based principles of a 
cognitive behavioral treatment program to guide the development of the best program for the unique needs of the youth and 
young adult population. 
This program will ramp down operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on June

responsible for providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The 
Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies utilizes the California Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model 
which incorporates evidence-based practices to elicit long-term behavioral change to reduce recidivism. Standard and 
specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the incarcerated person's risk 
and current service needs. Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification are regularly scheduled based on parolee 
behavior and stability in the community. Other components of supervision include the Sex Offender Management Program, 
which incorporates the control and containment model strategy as required by statute, and Global Positioning System (GPS) 
monitoring for all sex offenders. 
The other integral program component is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and 
services in each prison and includes the identification of parolee needs to match them with state and local programs to support 
successful transition into local communities.

5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and technical 
assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal justice system. 
This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, intervention, 
suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with 
the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for 
managing criminal justice populations. The Board seeks to ensure that its efforts are systematically informed by experts and 
stakeholders with subject matter expertise. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

5420   Prison Industry Authority 
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 
in a manner similar to private industry. CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee, 
the Secretary of the California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the 
Speaker of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by 
the Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the 
Board. 
CALPIA supports CDCR’s public safety mission by providing job training programs to incarcerated individuals. These programs 
are to help the incarcerated individuals develop job skills, establish good work habits, and obtain basic education and job 
support so that when they return to their communities they can gain meaningful employment and be productive and successful. 
CALPIA's number one goal is rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. 
CALPIA has three statutory objectives: (1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 
provide work opportunities for incarcerated individuals under the jurisdiction of CDCR; (2) create and maintain working 
conditions within enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure incarcerated individuals assigned 
therein the opportunity to work productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational 
skills; and (3) operate work programs for incarcerated individuals that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient 
funds from the sale of products and services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by 
CDCR. CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
