Education 
Education programs provide academic services 
segmented by pre-kindergarten, elementary, 
secondary, undergraduate and graduate programs 
as well as credentialing services to ensure 
schools are staffed with effective instructors. 
Elementary and secondary instruction is provided 
to all of California's children to prepare them for 
higher education or entry into the workforce. 
Institutions of higher education provide further 
access to the skills necessary for career goals and 
participation in a globally competitive workforce, 
as well as conducting research and providing 
public services. 
6100   Department of Education 
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6 million 
students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Operations and Administration Branch; 
the Opportunities for All Branch; the Student Achievement Branch; the Student Support Services Branch; the Information and 
Technology Branch; the Instruction, Measurement and Administration Branch; and the Legal, Audits and Charters Branch. 
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to administer K-12 education programs, to provide technical 
assistance to local school districts and offices of education and to work with the educational community to improve academic 
performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding local agencies accountable for student achievement in all 
programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity in utilizing a process of continual improvement that enables 
all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and supporting 
teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that promotes 
effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of 
TK-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing broader and more 
effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering systems of school, 
home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help students succeed, (h) 
advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that promotes good business 
practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Department. 
Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5310 - STATE LIBRARY SERVICES 
The State Library Services (SLS) program serves as the central reference and research library for the Governor, the 
Legislature, and state government officials and staff. SLS also provides library services to the public by making available 
collections and services in its branch libraries, special collections, and online. SLS gathers, catalogs, digitizes, preserves and 
protects information and materials. SLS answers reference and informational questions for local libraries and coordinates the 
distribution of state and federal publications to libraries. 
The Braille and Talking Book Library, a regional library designated by the Library of Congress National Library Service for the 
Blind and Print Disabled, provides Braille and recorded books (digital cartridges and downloadable files) and special playback 
equipment to blind and print-disabled residents of Northern California who are unable to use standard print materials. 
The Bernard E. Witkin State Law Library contains primary and secondary sources in American law, federal and state appellate 
court opinions, session laws, codes and statutes, federal agency decisions, and attorney general opinions of the U.S. and 55 
jurisdictions, with a particular focus in regulatory and legislative history.

6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System 
The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). 
The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members' 
creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an 
additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on 
July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three 
years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase 
the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 
The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in 
quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing 
power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection 
payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to

set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to 
CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an 
amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding 
calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15 
of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’ 
Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) 
increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

6350   School Facilities Aid Program 
The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities 
such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.  The programs are administered by the State Allocation 
Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 
The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility 
Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in 
statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.  These funds primarily 
support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through 
the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding 
relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7) 
seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general 
obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 
billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical 
education projects.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure 
a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 280,000 applications annually for 
2023-24 STATE BUDGET — EDU 42

EDUCATION
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the 
primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential 
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 
The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas, 
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including 
the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and 
development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the 
Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to 
monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of 
program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program 
approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated 
assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal 
advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of 
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and 
applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct 
disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions. 
5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES 
This program provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission in credential holder discipline 
cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process. 
5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT 
The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher 
preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface. 
5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS 
This program supports development and implementation of Performance Assessments for credential candidates in preparation 
programs that lead to a teaching or administrative services credential.  In addition to ensuring that credential candidates are 
prepared to enter the teaching profession or serve as a school administrator, candidate scores from these assessments will be 
included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment. 
5388 - CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING GRANT PROGRAM 
This program provides grants to K-12 local educational agencies to support recruitment of non-certificated school employees to 
participate in a teacher preparation program and become certificated classroom teachers in California public schools. 
5397 - EDUCATOR PREPARATION 
Provides funding for competitive grants to local educational agencies to recruit, prepare, and retain credentialed K-12 
educators. 
5399 - ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and internal 
administrative support services.

The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic 
programs through the doctoral degree level; research; continuing education for adult learners; and public service. 
The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 
1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the UC. The Board of Regents includes the following 26 members: 
7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms, and 1 student 
appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. The 
UC also serves students at all levels of higher education in California and serves as the public segment primarily responsible 
for awarding doctoral degrees and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 
There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa 
Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education. 
The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and 
administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States 
Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories. 
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource 
allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated 
authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

1 Campus-based fees vary by campus; values shown here are averages on a weighted basis using campus enrollment.  Campus-based fees for 2023-24 have not yet been determined and reflect a five-percent 
increase from 2022-23 levels. Campus-based fees do not include waivable health insurance fees. Waivable health insurance fees average $2,647 for undergraduate students and $5,118 for graduate students in 
2022-23.
2 In July 2021, the UC Board of Regents approved a multi-year Tuition Stability Plan that affects Tuition, the Student Services Fee, and Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (NRST). For undergraduate students 
entering fall 2022 and later, the three charges will be assessed on a cohort basis. For graduate students, the three charges will continue to be assessed on a uniform basis. The 2022-23 and 2023-24 amounts for 
undergraduate students, as shown in the display, reflect student fee levels for the cohort entering fall 2022 and fall 2023, respectively. Undergraduate students who started prior to fall 2022 will continue to pay 
2021-22 rates through 2026-27 for Tuition, the Student Services Fee, and NRST; their total charges in 2022-23 are $14,137 and $43,891 for resident and nonresident students, respectively, and their projected 
total charges in 2023-24 are $14,215 and $43,969 for resident and nonresident students, respectively.

Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, was approved by California voters on November 2, 2004, 
providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for stem cell research conducted at California universities, research 
institutions, and companies. It also established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to make grants and loans for 
stem cell research. The Institute's mission is to accelerate world class science to deliver transformative regenerative medicine 
treatments to a diverse California and worldwide in an equitable manner.

Proposition 14, the Stem Cell Research Institute Bond Initiative that was approved by California voters on November 8, 2020, 
authorized $5.5 billion in new general obligation bonds and increased the Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee from 29 
to 35 members, among other administrative and oversight changes. Proposition 14 also requires that revenues generated 
through licensing or self-commercializing an invention or technology that arises from research funded by CIRM be used to 
offset the costs of providing treatments and cures arising from CIRM-funded research to California patients who have 
insufficient means to purchase such treatment or cure, including the reimbursement of patient-qualified costs for research 
participants. 
The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 35-member governing board for the Institute. The members are public 
officials appointed on the basis of their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and research 
institutions, patient advocacy groups, and the life sciences biotechnology industry.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5530 - This program provides support for CLSF. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 
INSTRUCTION 
Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal 
profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 
The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal 
profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students 
with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism 
for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in 
overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 
The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference 
and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom 
presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law 
library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
Student services include admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support 
Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices provide 
students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist 
students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment 
opportunities. These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support 
Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other 
services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety, 
community relations, and administrative services. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and 
administration of maintenance and renovation activities for the college's plant. 
EXTRAMURAL 
Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. These 
include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in audiology, education, nursing practice, occupational 
therapy, physical therapy, and public health (anticipated to start during the 2023-24 academic year). The CSU also offers some 
doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 
The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16

develop systemwide policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the campuses, 
recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 
The CSU’s goals include to: 
• Advance and extend knowledge, learning, and culture, especially throughout California. 
• Provide opportunities for individuals to develop intellectually, personally, and professionally. 
• Prepare significant numbers of educated, responsible people to contribute to California’s schools, economy, culture, and 
future.  
• Encourage and provide access to an excellent education to all who are prepared for and wish to participate in collegiate 
study. 
• Offer undergraduate and graduate instruction leading to bachelor’s and higher degrees in the liberal arts and sciences, 
applied fields, and the professions, including the doctoral degree when authorized. 
• Prepare students for international, multi-cultural society.

INSTRUCTION 
The instruction category includes expenses for all activities that are part of an institution's instructional program. These 
activities include expenses for credit and noncredit courses; academic, vocational, and technical instruction; remedial and 
tutorial instruction; and regular, special, and extension sessions. 
RESEARCH 
The research category includes all expenses for activities specifically organized to produce research, whether commissioned 
by an agency external to the institution or separately budgeted by an organizational unit within the institution. These activities 
include expenses for individual and/or project research as well as that of institutes and research centers. 
PUBLIC SERVICES 
The public service category includes expenses for activities established primarily to provide non-instructional services 
beneficial to individuals and groups external to the institution. These activities include community service programs (excluding 
instructional activities) and cooperative extension services. Included in this category are conferences, institutes, general 
advisory services, reference bureaus, radio and television, consulting, and similar non-instructional services to particular 
sectors of the community. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT 
The academic support category includes expenses to provide support services to the institution’s primary missions: instruction, 
research, and public service. This category includes the retention, preservation, and display of educational materials, including 
libraries, museums, and galleries; the provision of services that directly assist the academic functions of the institution, such as 
demonstration schools associated with a department, school, or college of education; media such as audio-visual services and 
technology such as computing support; academic administration and personnel development providing administration support 
and management direction to the three primary missions; and separately budgeted support for course and curriculum 
development. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
The student services category includes expenses incurred for offices of admissions and the registrar and activities with the 
primary purpose of contributing to students' emotional and physical well-being and intellectual, cultural, and social development 
outside the context of the formal instruction program. This category includes expenses for student activities, cultural events, 
student newspapers, intramural athletics, student organizations, intercollegiate athletics, counseling and career guidance, 
student aid administration, and enrollment management and student health service offices. 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
The institutional support category includes expenses for central executive-level activities concerned with management and 
long-range planning for the entire institution, such as the governing board, planning and programming operations, and legal 
services; fiscal operations, including the investment office; administrative data processing; space management; employee 
personnel and records; logistical activities that provide procurement, storerooms, and printing; transportation services to the 
institution; support services to faculty and staff; and activities concerned with community and alumni relations, including 
development and fundraising. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
The operation and maintenance of plant category includes all expenses for the administration, supervision, operation, 
maintenance, preservation and protection of the institution's physical plant. This category includes expenses normally incurred 
for items such as janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture, and equipment; 
care of grounds; maintenance and operations of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster 
preparedness; safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to property; space and 
capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. 
STUDENT FINANCIAL AID 
Student financial aid includes institutional aid (State University Grants), tuition and fee waivers, scholarships, and fellowships 
from restricted or unrestricted funds. The category also includes trainee stipends, prizes, and awards. 
AUXILIARY ENTERPRISES 
An auxiliary enterprise exists to furnish goods or services to students, faculty, or staff, other institutional departments, or 
incidentally to the general public, and charges a fee directly related to the cost of the goods or services. The distinguishing 
characteristic of an auxiliary enterprise is that it is managed as an essentially self-supporting activity. Examples are residence

6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants 
This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their 
dependents. 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan. 
Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 
The 2022-23 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established 
in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members 
hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest 
health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also 
contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2022 monthly contribution 
maximums are $816 for a single enrollee, $1,548 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,983 for an enrollee and two or 
more dependents. The 2023 monthly contribution maximums are $883 for a single enrollee, $1,699 for an enrollee and one 
dependent, and $2,124 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges 
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 
California's 73 community college districts, which operate 116 community colleges. The Board has 18 voting members as 
specified in statute. Twelve members are appointed by the Governor, require Senate approval for six-year terms, and must 
include two current or former local board members. Five members are appointed by the Governor to two-year terms and 
include two students, two faculty members, and one classified member. The Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of 
the Board. 
The objectives of the Board are to: 
• Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 
• Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 
• Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 
related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see 
"Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5755 - FINANCIAL AID GRANTS PROGRAM 
This program provides grants and other kinds of financial aid to help undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at eligible 
institutions pay for educational expenses.  The financial aid programs are described below. 
CAL GRANT PROGRAM 
Cal Grant entitlement awards are guaranteed to students who graduate from high school and meet financial, academic, and 
other general program eligibility requirements.  The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are guaranteed 
to certain community college students who have a community college grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.4 on a four-point 
scale. 
Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility 
requirements.  These awards are offered to applicants who do not receive an entitlement award. 
Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 GPA on 
a four-point scale. 
Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point scale. 
The award is for books and living expenses for the first year.  Beginning with the second year, the award also provides funds for 
tuition and fees. 
The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the 
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU).  The annual Budget Act sets the award amount 
for recipients attending private nonprofit or private, for-profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of 
Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the award for recipients attending private, for-profit institutions that are not WASC-
accredited. 
The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training. 
The Cal Grant Students with Dependent Children Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for students 
with dependent children attending the UC, CSU, a California Community College, or eligible private nonprofit institution. 
The Cal Grant Foster Youth Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for current and former foster 
youth attending the UC, CSU, a California Community College, or an eligible private institution. 
The California Dream Act Service Incentive Grant Program provides grants to eligible Cal Grant recipients who apply for aid 
through the California Dream Act Application and complete community or volunteer service at a qualifying organization. 
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 
The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students. The maximum award amount 
for each student is determined by specific criteria and subject to funding provided in the annual Budget Act. 
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS 
The California Chafee Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 to eligible foster youth who are enrolled in college or 
vocational school at least half-time.  New and renewal awards are made based on available funding. 
The California Military Department GI Bill Award Program provides funding for active members of the California National Guard, 
the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia who seek a certificate, degree, or diploma.  Recipients attending the UC, CSU or 
a private institution may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant A award.  Recipients attending a community college may 
receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant B award.  An award used for graduate studies may not exceed the maximum amount 
of a Cal Grant A award plus $500 for books and supplies. 
 
The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents (LEPD) Scholarship Program provides college grants equivalent to Cal Grant 
amounts to dependents of California law enforcement officers, officers and employees of the Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation, and firefighters killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. 
The Golden State Teacher Grant Program provides one-time grants of up to $10,000 or $20,000 (depending on the institution 
where enrolled ) to students enrolled in a teacher preparation or pupil personnel services credential program who commit to 
teaching for four years at a qualifying school or preschool. 
The Learning Aligned Employment Program provides one-time grants to participating public postsecondary education 
institutions for the purposes of offering eligible students with the opportunity to earn money to help defray their educational 
costs, while gaining valuable education-aligned, career-related experience.

LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAMS 
The John R. Justice Program provides loan repayments to eligible recipients currently employed as California prosecutors or 
public defenders who commit to continued employment in that capacity for at least three years.  Recipients may receive up to 
$5,000 of loan repayment disbursed annually to their lending institutions. 
The Public Interest Attorney Loan Repayment Program provides a maximum of $11,000 in payments toward educational loans 
over a four year period to eligible recipients that work in public interest law. 
OUTREACH PROGRAMS 
The California Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal-SOAP), through intersegmental consortia, provides financial aid 
outreach, application assistance, and financial aid literacy resources to disadvantaged K-12 students. 
Cash for College provides financial aid workshops to assist low-income students with completing an application for financial aid 
and the Cal Grant GPA Verification Form and understanding financial aid.
