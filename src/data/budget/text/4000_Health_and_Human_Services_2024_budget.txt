The Hospital Fair Billing Program receives and investigates consumer complaints regarding hospital billing and enforces the 
hospital fair pricing policies. The Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) has three primary responsibilities: managing cost 
growth targets, monitoring system performance, and assessing market consolidation. OHCA will collect, analyze, and publicly 
report data on total health care expenditures, and enforce cost growth targets set by a new Health Care Affordability Board. To 
ensure a balanced approach to managing costs, OHCA will monitor system performance by measuring quality, equity, adoption 
of alternative payment models, investment in primary care and behavioral health, and workforce stability. Through cost and 
market impact reviews, OHCA will analyze transactions that are likely to significantly impact on market competition, the state’s 
ability to meet cost targets, or affordability for consumers and purchasers. Based on results of the review, OHCA will then 
coordinate with other state agencies to address consolidation as appropriate. 
3835 - HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE 
The Health Care Workforce Program improves access to medical, mental, and dental health care providers in underserved 
areas throughout California. The Program conducts research to identify areas of unmet need and administers grants that 
provide financial incentives to individuals and institutions to increase the number of providers in those areas. The Program 
promotes health care workforce diversity and cultural competency. It includes the following programs: 
• Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Program 
• Mental Health Services Act Workforce Education and Training Program 
• Health Professions Careers Opportunity Program 
• Health Workforce Pilot Projects Program 
• Health Workforce Research Data Center 
• California Primary Care Office which includes the Shortage Designation Program 
• California State Office of Rural Health includes: 
• The J-1 Visa Waiver Program 
• Small Hospital Improvement Program 
• Medicare Critical Access Hospital Flexibility Program 
• California Health Workforce Education and Training Council 
• Scholarship Programs 
• Loan Repayment Programs, including the California State Loan Repayment Program, Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps 
Loan Repayment Program and Licensed Mental Health Services Provider Education Program 
• Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Workforce Programs 
3840 - FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT 
The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and 
construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of 
providing sustained services to the public. 
3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE 
The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and 
nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors 
the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating 
access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California. 
The Distressed Hospital Loan Program requires HCAI and the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (CHFFA) to 
collaboratively administer the Distressed Hospital Loan Program to offer interest-free, working capital loans to non-profit and 
publicly-operated financially distressed hospitals, including hospitals that belong to integrated health care systems with no more 
than two separately licensed hospitals in California that are facing a risk of closure, while they implement turnaround strategies 
to regain financial viability.  HCAI contracts with CHFFA through an Inter-Agency Agreement to administer the loan program. 
The founding legislation also includes provisions requiring hospitals to submit quarterly financial data to HCAI, for use in 
monitoring the financial health of hospitals throughout the state. 
3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 
The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from 
approximately 9,500 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and treatment 
data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory 
surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers,

health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media. To further this 
mission, the Health Care Information Program is implementing new health care cost transparency data programs to collect and 
analyze prescription drug cost data, hospital supplier diversity data, hospital quality and equity data, and health care payment 
data to improve transparency, inform policy decisions, reduce disparities, and reduce health care costs. 
3860 - ADMINISTRATION

4170   California Department of Aging 
The Department of Aging's mission is to transform aging for individuals, families, and communities by leading innovative 
programs, planning, policies, and partnerships that increase choices, equity, and well-being for all Californians as we age. The 
population served includes older adults, people with disabilities, and family caregivers. 
As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the California Department of Aging (CDA) administers federal Older 
Americans Act programs that provide a wide variety of home and community-based supportive services through contracts with 
a statewide network of 33 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and the 11 statewide Caregiver Resource Centers (CRCs). The 
Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs; it contracts directly with agencies that operate 37 Multipurpose Senior 
Services Program (MSSP) sites and certifies 289 Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS) centers for participation in Medi-
Cal.  In addition, the Department oversees implementation of the Governor’s Master Plan for Aging and California’s efforts to 
build a No Wrong Door system centered in the development of the Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC) program 
to provide person centered counseling and support to older adults, people with disabilities, and family caregivers. CDA 
administers the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP) that provides individualized counseling to 
Medicare beneficiaries, and houses the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program with oversight for the rights of residents in 
long-term care facilities.

isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and 
assistance, employment, and education. 
3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 
The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized 
training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also 
promotes transition to unsubsidized employment. 
3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 
This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers, 
grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance, 
legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term 
Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support 
necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care 
services appropriate to their needs. 
CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS 
This program provides support and resources to family caregivers of adults affected by chronic and debilitating health 
conditions, degenerative diseases, or traumatic brain injuries and adults 60 years and older in need of assistance with daily 
living activities such as, bathing, eating, or getting dressed.? There are 11 nonprofit Caregiver Resource Centers that provide 
services in each county. 
3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 
This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides 
personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local 
source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans. 
3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services 
(CBAS) program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social 
care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who 
otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to 
adults 18 years of age or over who are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health 
conditions and/or disabilities. The Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. 
3915 - POLICY AND PLANNING 
This program is responsible for Aging policy research, analysis, and development for the State’s Aging programs. The program 
specifically addresses policy and planning related to inclusion and isolation prevention, equity-in-aging, housing and livable 
communities, and health in the home and community.

The Department of Developmental Services (Department) is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities 
Services Act for overseeing the coordination and delivery of services and supports that persons with developmental disabilities 
need to lead more independent and productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets 
broad policy and provides leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities and standards within which 
the developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate 
problems that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community 
agencies known as regional centers as well as through state-operated programs. The Department, through contracts with the 
21 regional centers, oversees through audits and other review the coordination of services to persons with developmental 
disabilities; provides that such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each 
stage of their lives; and, to the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community. 
Because the Department’s programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4140 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM 
Through the network of regional centers, the Department contracts with regional centers to support the development and 
maintenance of services for eligible persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers 
directly provide or coordinate the following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis, 
(3) counseling, (4) lifelong individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the 
individual program plan, (6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of 
legal, civil, and service rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning, 
placement, and monitoring for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, 
(12) community education about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services. 
4145 - STATE-OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM 
The Department currently operates two larger residential facilities: Fairview Developmental Center (Orange County), which is in 
warm shutdown, and Porterville Developmental Center (Tulare County). Secure treatment services are provided at the 
Porterville Developmental Center for individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial due to their developmental 
disability or are dangerous to themselves or others and civilly committed to the facility by court order. The Department also 
operates Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences in Northern, Central, and Southern 
California to provide acute crisis services in the community. Finally, the Department leases one community facility for persons 
who require specialized behavioral interventions and acute crisis stabilization: Canyon Springs in Cathedral City (Riverside 
County). Under the California Department of Public Health, Porterville Developmental Center is licensed as a General Acute 
Care Hospital and Intermediate Care Facility, and Canyon Springs Community Facility operates as an Intermediate Care 
Facility. 
STAR residences operate as community crisis homes. Services involve the provision of active treatment through residential 
and day programs on a 24-hour basis, including appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, and 
assistance with activities of daily living, training, education, and employment. 
Individuals served in the STAR crisis residences are committed by a court order to the Department for suitable treatment and 
habilitation services during a crisis and are provided services and supports necessary to prepare them for return to their home 
or to transition to a new living option. The primary objective of this program is to provide a safety net of services that include 
providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents based upon assessed need and as outlined in 
each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most efficient, effective, and least restrictive manner 
to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system and are designed to teach individuals the skills for 
increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and welfare, and enhance personal competence in 
all areas of daily living. 
4149 - PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of this program is to: (1) provide overall management, planning and policy development, legal, legislative, audit, 
and administrative services; (2) manage revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state programs, insurance 
companies, and private payers; (3) monitor regional center operations for compliance with statute, regulations, and their 
contract with the Department; (4) provide central administrative and clinical management services to the state-operated 
programs to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with state licensing and federal certification requirements, 
protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility structures and grounds; and (5) oversee areas that include the 
development of policies and procedures for developmental center operations, law enforcement and protective services, 
population management, program and fiscal oversight, and facility planning and support.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of facilities under its control, 
including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities 
are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County. 
The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet on 784 acres. As of February 2020, 
the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former residents to community 
living. The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until disposition of the property. 
The Department is projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences that 
provide acute crisis services in the community. Additionally, the Department is responsible for the maintenance of interior 
finishes and equipment at Canyon Springs, a 57,000-square-foot leased facility in Riverside County. These facilities support the 
Department's mission in providing medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision; education; and vocational 
training for residents with developmental disabilities committed to a state-operated facility.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS 
The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through 
financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization, and renewable energy services. 
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households 
to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related 
emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard 
the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-
income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides energy efficiency and renewable energy services in low-income 
single-family farmworker and multi-family dwellings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs. LIWP 
projects include weatherization and solar photovoltaic system installations. 
4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES 
The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is designed to enable local government and nonprofit community organizations 
to help low-income families achieve and maintain economic security through a broad range of activities. These activities include 
education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional 
services, among others. 
The California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax 
credits to boost the income of eligible individuals and families. Since 2017-18, the Department has worked with the Franchise 
Tax Board to provide grant opportunities for community-based organizations to increase awareness of CalEITC and free tax 
preparation assistance programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES 
The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities through 
vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that individuals with 
disabilities may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In 
addition, the Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education, 
behavioral/mental health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of 
Selection process, which gives priority to individuals with the most significant disabilities. 
Individuals with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range 
of services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, 
supported employment and independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their 
communities. The Department provides Work Incentives Planning services to reduce dependency on public benefits. The 
Department provides career counseling and information and referral services to encourage individuals working in non-
competitive, non-integrated settings to work toward and achieve competitive integrated employment. 
The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition student services, known as DOR Student Services, and 
auxiliary aids and services necessary to participate in such services to a wide range of students with disabilities, ages 16 up to 
22 (depending on their exit from their special education program), including many who may benefit from early career 
development. DOR Student Services include job exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary 
education counseling, workplace readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy.  
The Department, through its Business Enterprises Program, provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to 
enable individuals who are blind or visually impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and 
cafeterias. Prevocational, including employment readiness, services are provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to 
consumers with vision loss to prepare them for independent living. 
The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation 
services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and 
establishes fees for services provided to its consumers. 
The Department administers the Pathways to Success Project (PSP) to increase competitive integrated employment outcomes, 
economic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion, through a unique service delivery design supported by sector-specific 
teams specializing in high-wage, high-skill, and high-demand careers for individuals with disabilities. The PSP, which is a pilot 
research project, is particularly targeted at underrepresented communities, including people of color, women, and individuals 
with intellectual or developmental disabilities.  
The Department administers the California Subminimum Wage to Competitive Integrated Employment Project (CSP) to provide 
a comprehensive set of interventions and supports to increase competitive integrated employment outcomes, independence, 
economic self-sufficiency, and inclusion for individuals with the most significant disabilities currently in, or contemplating 
entering, subminimum wage employment. The CSP, which is a pilot research project, will establish evidence-based approaches 
to vocational rehabilitation service delivery that will improve the employment outcomes of its participants, transitioning more 
workers with disabilities into competitive integrated employment. 
The Department administers the Integrated Employment in Recovery program (IER) to provide training to the provider 
workforce on evidence-based practices to serve people with substance use disorders (SUD) related to opioid use that can be 
incorporated as a part of holistic recovery. The training focuses on incorporating the full range of vocational rehabilitation 
services into treatment delivery as part of a whole-person approach to recovery and developing supports for individuals 
returning to or transitioning into work during and following treatment.  
4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES 
The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout 
California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently with full 
inclusion in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems 
change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion 
services to community-based living, and transition services to postsecondary life for youth. 
The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their 
families, six service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for individuals with 
TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for 
family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to 
administer a TBI partnership grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a 
TBI state plan, sustainability plan, statewide TBI registry, and needs assessment. 
In addition, the Department expands the capacity of existing TBI sites and stands up new TBI sites in alignment with Home and 
Community-Based Services surrounding transition and diversion through community reintegration, personal care services 
through supported living services, and other supportive services to improve functional capabilities of individuals with TBI.

The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 16 non-profit community-based 
organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually 
impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low 
vision evaluations/screenings, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, 
independent living skills training, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services. 
Through a partnership with the California Public Utilities Commission’s Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, the 
Department’s Voice Options program provides eligible Californians who are unable to speak, or who have difficulty speaking, 
with a free speech-generating device. The goal of this program is to ensure full and equal telephone communications access 
for all Californians with disabilities. 
The Department administers the Community Living Fund program that provides transition or diversion services to individuals to 
support community-based living which enables older adults and people with disabilities to access funding to move from an 
institutional setting to the community or to support individuals who are at risk of going into an institution to remain in their 
community. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM 
The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing 
parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and 
enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-
D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families block grant. 
4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION: 
The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating 
expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The 
federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs. 
4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION: 
Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal 
certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State 
Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts 
and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support 
Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments 
from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program 
provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS 
The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support 
themselves. These programs are comprised of five components: 
• California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) 
• Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food 
Assistance Programs 
• Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program 
• County Administration and Automation Projects 
• Disaster Relief 
The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to 
enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor, 
administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services. 
4270010 - CalWORKs: 
The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is 
California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic 
needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes 
specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet 
these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs 
recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Parents have the right to choose child care 
among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs families are then able to meet both 
goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and development services. 
4270019 - Other Assistance Payments: 
The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term 
residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as 
a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is 
administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social 
Services as authorized by federal and state law. 
The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to relative guardians of children who were 
previously in the foster care system. 
The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate 
the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in 
accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and 
state law. 
California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs: 
• The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States 
provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs. 
• The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and 
independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States 
unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the 
minor. 
• The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human 
trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are 
available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under 
CalWORKs). 
The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of 
nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of 
purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations 
eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits 
due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program. 
The CalFresh Employment and Training Program allows certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in 
employment and training activities.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The federal SUN Bucks program provides summer food benefits to school-age children who qualify for free or reduced-priced 
meals. Eligible children are provided with $40 per month for June, July, and August for a total of $120. 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution 
to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for 
household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with 
food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a 
state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses. 
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious 
supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity 
Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services 
on October 1, 2016. 
4270020 - Child Care and Development: 
The Child Care and Development program reflects services transitioned to the Department of Social Services from the 
Department of Education, effective July 1, 2021. This includes but is not limited to Stages Two and Three of CalWORKs Child 
Care, migrant day care, and Child and Adult Care Food Programs. 
4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program: 
The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled 
persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a 
State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who 
determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients. 
4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects: 
Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who 
administer public assistance programs. 
Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services. 
4270046 - Disaster Relief: 
The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have 
suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance 
programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select 
recovery grants. 
4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING 
The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child 
welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and 
procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of 
the service delivery system. 
4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services: 
The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in 
their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who 
either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs 
that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option, 
and IHSS-Residual Program. 
4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing: 
The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse 
Prevention. 
Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and 
prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated 
services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with 
the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and 
least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from 
foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff. 
In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is responsible for implementing continuum of care 
reforms codified in Chapter 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to 
services without having to change out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and 
families in assessment and case planning.

The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and 
private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for 
children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services 
include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents; 
training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For 
independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the 
biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice. 
The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and 
sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and 
services for at risk families and their children. 
The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of abuse, neglect, or financial 
exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary. 
The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health 
and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes 
facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components. 
4275028 - Special Programs: 
These programs include but are not limited to programs such as Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance, 
Access Assistance to the Deaf, Housing Program, Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services, 
and Legal Services for Unaccompanied and Undocumented Minors. 
4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES 
The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and 
provide administrative services to other agencies. 
4285010 - Disability Evaluation: 
The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents 
applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of 
the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and 
overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. 
4285019 - Services to Other Agencies: 
In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative 
services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human 
Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public 
information services.

5195   1991 State-Local Realignment 
In the 1991-92 fiscal year, State-Local Program Realignment restructured the state-county partnership by giving counties 
increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment 
provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT 
The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve 
improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability 
for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage 
cost-effective approaches to providing services. 
Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts 
are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified 
in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to 
ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision 
ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for 
county health and social services programs.

Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services, 
and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is 
appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and 
technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at 
less cost. 
The funding sources for realignment are: 
• The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax. 
• The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts: 
• Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services) 
• Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care; 
Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment) 
• Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs) 
• Trial Court Security Subaccount 
• Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and 
Adult Parole) 
• Community Corrections Subaccount 
• District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount 
• Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant 
Special Account) 
The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on 
statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures.
