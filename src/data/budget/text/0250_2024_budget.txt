0250   Judicial Branch 
Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of 
the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. 
Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially 
unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 
The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent 
funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was 
implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This 
implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The 
county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty 
revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments 
to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted 
by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act 
of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the 
counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial 
Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are 
deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of 
court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities 
based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 
The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, 
impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United 
States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 
Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

 Prior-Year Actuals 
Current-Year Estimated
1/ Reflects the 2022-23 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the trial courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for 2022-23. Non-
state funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc.
2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the trial courts. Excludes judges who are constitutional officers and not trial court employees.
3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 33 trial courts based on courts' 2023-24 Schedule 1 submissions. Courts without a Schedule 1 have been noted with an asterisk (*).
4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Trial courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2022-23 and estimated expenditures for 2023-24 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2023 Enacted Budget.
5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not 
included in the trial courts’ state funding in Section 1.
6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts 
reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding 
Not Distributed to Trial Courts" (Figure 2) amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for the "State Trial Court Funding Total."
7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting 
differences.  For the current year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.

Total, State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts 
5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to 
the JBWCF. 
1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, and GF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state operations 
component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). Expenditures are rounded to the nearest thousand.
2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, 
Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount in 
this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1). 
4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of trial courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training 
(DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects the appropriated funds 
for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program (FFDRP).
3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid, excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" (Figure 1) 
revenue amounts reported ($153.392 million in 2022-23 and $183.765 million in 2023-24). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by 
the TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2022-23 and 2023-24 participated in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0130 - SUPREME COURT 
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state 
courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the 
Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations 
for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of 
statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the 
Supreme Court. 
0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 
Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six 
District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the 
Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 
0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 
The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21 
voting members and 9 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as the 
administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation of 
the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and 
administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges, 
technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 
0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM 
The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of 
judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real 
estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction. 
0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING 
California has 58 trial courts, one in each county. In trial courts, or superior courts, a judge and sometimes a jury hears 
witnesses' testimony and other evidence and decides cases by applying the relevant law to the facts. Trial courts have trial 
jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases. To accomplish various statutory mandates, the State Trial Court Funding Program 
supports trial courts through the following programs: 
0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS 
This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and 
criminal cases. This program includes all allowable trial court administrative costs under Government Code section 77003. 
0150011 - COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNSEL 
This program provides funding for court-appointed counsel for children, non-minor dependents and parents in juvenile court 
dependency proceedings pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 317, subdivisions (b) and (c), and Government 
Code section 77003, subdivision (a)(4). 
0150019 - COMPENSATION OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES 
This program provides funding for the salaries and state benefits for Superior Court judges. 
0150028 - ASSIGNED JUDGES 
This program provides support for the salaries and related costs of retired as well as active judges who are assigned by the 
Chief Justice to positions in courts which require assistance due to judicial absences or other factors impacting the ability of a 
court to avoid case delay. 
0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS 
This program supports the provision of qualified language interpreters in criminal, juvenile, family, mental competency, 
Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Act, and civil proceedings as required by statute. 
0150046 - GRANTS 
This program provides funding for government grants providing public services related to the trial courts. 
0150051 – CHILD SUPPORT COMMISSIONER PROGRAM (AB 1058)

0150067 – COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE (CASA) PROGRAM 
This program provides funding for non-profits designated by the court to train and provide volunteers to advocate for children in 
foster care. 
0150083 – EQUAL ACCESS FUND 
This program provides funding to the Legal Services Trust Fund Commission of the State Bar of California to fund for legal 
services programs to providinge a range of services to low-income litigants. 
0150095 - EXPENSES ON BEHALF OF THE TRIAL COURT 
This program provides appropriation for statewide programs and services provided to the court or courts by the Judicial Council 
or payment for services or property of any kind contracted for the court or courts or on behalf of the courts by the Judicial 
Council, which are paid for or reimbursed by the trial courts. The appropriation also supports the implementation and 
administration of the Sargent Shriver Civil Counsel Pilot Program. 
In addition to the programs mentioned above, the State Trial Court Funding Program supports Children in Dependency Cases 
Training. 
0155 - HABEAS CORPUS RESOURCE CENTER 
The Habeas Corpus Resource Center provides legal representation for indigent petitioners in death penalty habeas corpus 
proceedings before the California state courts and the federal courts. The Center also serves as a resource center for the 
private capital defense bar, and it recruits and trains attorneys to expand the pool of private counsel qualified to accept 
appointments in death penalty habeas corpus proceedings, and thereby helps to reduce the number of unrepresented indigents 
on California's death row.
