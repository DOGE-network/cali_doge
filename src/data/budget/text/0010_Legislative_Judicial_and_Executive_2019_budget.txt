Legislative, 
Judicial, and 
Executive 
Governmental bodies classified under the 
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive section of the 
Governor's Budget are either established as 
independent entities under the California 
Constitution, or are departments with a recognized 
need to operate outside of the administrative 
oversight and control of an agency secretary. 
Constitutionally-established bodies include the 
Legislature, Judicial Branch, Governor's Office, 
and constitutional officers. This section also 
includes such independent entities as the 
Inspector General and the California State Lottery. 
0110   Senate 
The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. The State Senate is comprised of 40 members who are elected for 4-year terms. 
Members of the Legislature may serve a maximum of 12 years total in the Senate, the Assembly, or both, in any combination of 
terms. Members first elected before June 6, 2012, however, may generally serve a maximum of 14 years total, with no more

0130   Joint Expenses 
The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal 
and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee. 
Because the Legislature's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to 
support this need.  For the specifics on the Legislature's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was 
completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for 
construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.  The Annex, which was 
completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices. 
Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored, 
rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System 
Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional 
officers, and legislative statutory officers. 
 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of 
its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death, 
disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions. The Legislators' 
Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 
 
Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November 
6, 1990. Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340) 
closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory 
officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau 
The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members 
and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The 
legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending as counsel meetings of legislative 
committees, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all work is 
confidential. 
In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative 
measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes. 
The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the legislative 
information system and the processing of legislative measures.

0250   Judicial Branch 
Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of 
the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. 
Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially 
unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 
The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent 
funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was 
implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This 
implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The 
county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty 
revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments 
to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted 
by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act 
of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the 
counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial 
Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are 
deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of 
court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities 
based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 
The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, 
impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United 
States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 
Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For additional information regarding the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see 
"Infrastructure Overview."

5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. Funds either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the superior courts’ 
state funding in Section 1.
6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and 
Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total 
expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total".
7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences.  For the current 
year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.
8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2017-18 and estimated expenditures for 2018-19 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2019-20 Enacted Budget.

funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc.
2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the superior courts. Does not include judges, who are constitutional officers and not court employees.
3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 58 superior courts based on courts' final certified 2018-19 Schedule 1 submissions. 
4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.

5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to the JBWCF.  For 
the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.
1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" expenses from all funds, including the Trial Court Trust Fund (TCTF), State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund (IMF), General Fund (GF), and Judicial Branch Workers' 
Compensation Fund (JBWCF).  The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs have a state operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed 
dependency counsel).
2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" 
display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State 
Trial Court Funding Total". 
4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of superior courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training (DRAFT) Program. 
Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel.
3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" revenue amounts reported in the 
Trial Court Information section ($127.4 million in 2017-18 and $138.3 million in 2018-19). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura County Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In 
addition, 23 courts in 2017-18 and 2018-19 participate in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0130 - SUPREME COURT 
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state 
courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the 
Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations 
for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of 
statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the 
Supreme Court. 
0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 
Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six 
District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the 
Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 
0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 
The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21 
voting members and 11 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as 
the administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation 
of the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and 
administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges, 
technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 
0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM

Code section 77003, subdivision (a)(4). 
0150019 - COMPENSATION OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES 
This program provides funding for the salaries and state benefits for Superior Court judges. 
0150028 - ASSIGNED JUDGES 
This program provides support for the salaries and related costs of retired as well as active judges who are assigned by the 
Chief Justice to positions in courts which require assistance due to judicial absences or other factors impacting the ability of a 
court to avoid case delay. 
0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS 
This program supports the provision of qualified language interpreters in criminal, juvenile, family and civil proceedings as 
required by statute.

Council, which are paid for or reimbursed by the trial courts. The appropriation also supports the implementation and 
administration of the Civil Representation Pilot Program. 
0155 - HABEAS CORPUS RESOURCE CENTER

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Judicial Branch consists of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, trial courts, and the Judicial Council. The Supreme Court 
is located in the Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco (101,500 square feet) and the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los 
Angeles (7,600 sf). The courts of appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of 
approximately 508,000 sf. The trial courts are located in 58 counties statewide, in approximately 500 buildings and 2,100 
courtrooms of approximately 16 million sf of usable area and more than 21 million sf of space under Judicial Council 
responsibility and management. The facilities of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and trial courts encompass not only the 
public courtroom spaces but also the chambers and workspaces where judicial officers and courtroom staff prepare for 
proceedings; secure areas, including holding cells; and building support functions. Judicial Council administrative facilities, 
occupying approximately 260,000 sf, are located in San Francisco and Sacramento.

0280   Commission on Judicial Performance 
The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of 
judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California 
Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of 
California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or 
resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees. 
In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement. 
The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial 
misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation 
and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal 
from office. 
The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the 
Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, 
and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms. 
Commission members do not receive a salary.

0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and 
Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement 
System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members. 
The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in 
1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System 
II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final 
compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement 
System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of 
contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined 
benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives 
contributions from judges equal to 8 percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted 
annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund. 
The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, 
compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges 
and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing 
fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit 
payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the 
required benefit payments to retired judges. 
 
Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 
2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2019-20 Governor's Budget.
4/ The 2019 Budget Act estimates 2019-20 administrative expenditures to be $2,045,000 for the Judges' Retirement Fund 
and $2,325,000 for the Judges' Retirement System II Fund, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its 
May 2019 meeting.
3/ The 2019 Budget Act estimates 2019-20 state contributions to be $265,785,000 to the Judges' Retirement System, and 
$85,226,000 to the Judges' Retirement System II.  The 2019 Budget Act estimates 2019-20 pension benefit payments to be 
$222,759,000 from the Judges' Retirement Fund and $31,365,000 from the Judges' Retirement System II Fund.  The 
revisions in the estimates from the 2019-20 Governor's Budget to the 2019 Budget Act are the result of (1) changes in the 
number of active and retired members in both systems, (2) an increase in member salaries, and (3) an increase in the 
employer contribution rate to the Judges' Retirement System II, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its 
February 2019 meeting.
2/ This display does not reflect the $40 million payment in 2019-20 for the post judgment award in Robert M. Mallano, 
Individually, and on Behalf of a Class of Similarly Situated Persons v. John Chiang, Controller of the State of California 
(Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC-533770).

recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature regarding policies, programs, and actions to advance statewide 
economic goals. 
0225 - CALIFORNIA BUSINESS INVESTMENT SERVICES

through state-designated iHubs. 
0230 - OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE 
The director of the Office of the Small Business Advocate (OSBA) serves as the principal advocate in the state on behalf of 
small businesses, including legislation and administrative regulations that affect small business. The OSBA is responsible for 
disseminating information about programs and services provided by the state that benefit small businesses, and how small

The California Tourism Market Act provides for the marketing of California through an assessment of businesses that benefit 
from travel and tourism. The objective of the Tourism Assessment Program is to identify potentially assessable businesses, 
assist companies with determining the appropriate amount of their self-assessment, and collet the fee. 
0235028 - CALIFORINIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK 
California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (IBank) was created to finance public infrastructure and private 
development that promote a healthy climate for jobs, contribute to a strong economy and improve the quality of life in California 
communities. IBank has a broad authority to issue tax-exempt and taxable revenue bonds, provide financing to public 
agencies, provide credit enhancements, acquire or lease facilities, and leverage State and Federal funds. IBank's current 
programs include the infrastructure state revolving fund, 501(c)(3) tax-exempt and taxable revenue bond program, industrial 
development revenue bond program, exempt facility revenue bond program, governmental bond program and the Clean 
Energy Finance Center (CEFC) and the Statewide Energy Efficiency Program under the CEFC. 
0235037 - SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM 
The Small Business Loan Guarantee Program (SBLGP) promotes local economic development by providing guarantees for 
loans issued to small businesses from financial institutions, typically banks, that otherwise would not approve a term loan or 
line of credit to a small business. As a result of the SBLGP, participating small businesses are able to secure financing that 
allows them to grow and expand their business. The loan guarantee serves as a credit enhancement and an incentive for 
financial institutions to make loans to small businesses that otherwise would not be eligible for such financing. 
0235046 - CALIFORNIA WELCOME CENTERS 
California Welcome Centers are visitor information centers that are readily accessible to and recognizable by tourists to

Program is to determine the locality of underserved travelers, designate a welcome center, and establish operating standards 
across the network. 
0240 - COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM

competitive grant program mandated by Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, and the provisions specified in 
Revenue and Taxation Code section 34019(d). The CalCRG administers grants for local public health departments and 
qualified community-based nonprofit organizations to support various mental health treatment, substance use treatment, job 
placement, legal services and other health and wellness-related programs for communities disproportionately affected by past 
federal and state drug policies in California. GO-Biz must award grants annually and at least 50 percent of the grant funding will 
be allocated to qualified community-based nonprofit organizations.

0552   Office of the Inspector General 
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional 
system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's 
(CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, and the employee disciplinary process. When requested by the Governor, 
the Senate Committee on Rules, or the Speaker of the Assembly, the Inspector General reviews the policies, practices, and 
procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the 
state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the state's juvenile facilities, and conducts metric-oriented 
inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at each state prison. OIG receives communications from 
individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-free public telephone number to receive allegations of 
wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; conducts formal reviews of complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper 
management where a legally cognizable cause of action is present; and reviews the mishandling of sexual abuse incidents 
within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the state correctional system by publicly reporting 
its findings. 
In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (Board) that examines CDCR's various mental 
health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for inmates and parolees. The Board meets at least twice 
annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of offender rehabilitation and treatment programs. The Board 
also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of 
treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of offenders, gaps in offender rehabilitation services, and levels of offender participation 
and success.

0690   Office of Emergency Services 
The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build capabilities, and 
support our communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's Homeland Security 
Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's homeland security and 
counter-terrorism strategy. The Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting against, 
responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of all hazards and threats. 
On a day-to-day basis, Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and 
coordinates with federal agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector 
resources in emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on 
its own resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. The Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with 
those of the federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California. 
During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's 
responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal 
assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the 
development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes 
prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 
The Cal OES implements the state homeland security strategy by overseeing the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), 
which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center (STAC). The STAS is comprised of four regional and one 
major urban area Fusion Centers that assist in the detection, prevention, investigation, and response to criminal and terrorist 
activity; and information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. The 
STAC operates as the state's information-sharing clearinghouse for strategic threat analysis, counter-terrorism, situational 
awareness reporting, and case analysis for statewide leadership, agencies, and public safety community. Further, Cal OES 
improves the criminal justice system in California by providing financial and technical assistance to local governments, state 
agencies, and the private sector for homeland security, public safety, and victim services. 
Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• California Disaster Assistance Act — The Budget includes an augmentation of $28.8 million one-time General Fund to 
increase the amount of funding available through the California Disaster Assistance Act (CDAA), which is used to repair, 
restore, or replace public real property damaged or destroyed by a disaster, and to reimburse local governments for costs 
associated with certain emergency activities undertaken in response to a state of emergency. This augmentation increases 
total available funding for CDAA to $91.4 million in 2019-20. 
• Public Safety Power Shutdown — The Budget includes $75 million one-time General Fund to improve resiliency of the state's 
critical infrastructure and provide grants to communities to improve local planning and preparedness in response to utility-led 
Public Safety Power Shutdown events. 
• State Emergency Telephone Number Account, Broadbrand Communication, and 9-1-1 Advancements and Integration — The 
Budget includes a $50 million one-time General Fund investment, that will be deposited into the State Emergency Telephone 
Network Account (SETNA), to continue implementing improvements to the state's 9-1-1 system. In addition, the Budget 
includes $1 million ongoing SETNA to support the implementation and workload associated with emergency communications 
coordination and First Responder Network Authority broadband network services. 
• Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery — The Budget includes $26.6 million General Fund and $900,000 Federal 
Trust Fund (FTF) in 2019-20 and $6.6 million General Fund and $900,000 FTF ongoing to enhance the state's disaster 
preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities, support the continuity of state government during disasters, and maximize 
eligible federal reimbursements. 
• Mutual Aid System — The Budget includes $25 million ongoing General Fund for prepositioning of existing OES and local 
government resources that are part of the statewide mutual aid system with the goal of enhancing disaster response readiness. 
Prepositioning occurs in areas of identified potential fire threat, which is determined through various means such as weather 
modeling, high wind zones, low humidity, and dense fire load. The prepositioned resources include, but are not limited to, fire 
engines, trucks, personnel, and strike teams. 
• California Earthquake Early Warning System — The Budget includes $16.3 million one-time General Fund to complete 
activities associated with finishing the build-out of the California Earthquake Early Warning System, including finishing seismic 
stations installation, adding GPS stations to the network, improving telemetry, and launching a statewide education and 
outreach campaign. The California Earthquake Early Warning System is anticipated to be operative statewide by June 2021. 
• California State Nonprofit Security Grant Program — The Budget includes $15 million one-time General Fund to support 
target hardening and other physical security enhancements to assist non-profit organizations that are at high risk of a terrorist 
attack and that have historically been targets of hate-motivied violence based on ideology and beliefs.

state, and local resources, through the mutual aid system to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended in a 
disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-hazards 
approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National Strategy on 
Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this program, 
Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to all 
hazards. 
0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 
The Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim 
services grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of 
Homeland Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency 
management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant 
management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with 
financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center which is the 
centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion 
center. 
0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 
Public Safety Communications (PSC) serves the State of California by providing public safety communications to the state's 
first responders and oversight of the 9-1-1 system to the people of California. The PSC is dedicated to the preservation and 
protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services keeping the public 
connected during times of crisis. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE 
The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of Cal OES and support services such as 
accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.

0730   Governor Elect and Outgoing Governor 
These funds are to provide assistance to the Governor-elect and the outgoing Governor, during the transition period following 
the election, in carrying out the duties described under the provisions of Government Code Sections 12015 and 12015.5. 
The law provides that state agencies furnish to the Governor-elect any information or assistance necessary in the preparation 
of the annual state budget and for the orderly transfer of the executive power. This gives the Governor-elect approximately two 
months to formulate policies and to incorporate them in the various programs included in the Budget, which will be transmitted 
to the Legislature. 
The law also provides for the outgoing Governor to appoint persons for up to a two-month period, to assist in concluding 
matters arising from official duties during the last term of office. 
Of the $1,000,000 budgeted, $865,000 is for the Governor-elect and $135,000 is for the outgoing Governor.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0435 - LEGAL SERVICES 
Legal Services is organized into three elements: (1) Civil Law, (2) Criminal Law, and (3) Public Rights. 
Civil Law represents the State of California and its officers, agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and employees in 
civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them and prosecutes cases to vindicate state 
interests. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases before administrative 
tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the United States and 
California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of nine sections: Business and Tax; Cannabis Control; Correctional Law; 
Employment and Administrative Mandates; Government Law; Health, Education and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement; 
Licensing; or Tort and Condemnation. 
Criminal Law represents the People of the State of California in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts. 
Criminal Law also fulfills the Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are 
recused, conducts criminal investigations, represents the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole 
decisions and conditions of confinement in the state prisons and defends criminal judgements in state and federal habeas 
corpus matters. Additional responsibilities include enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition 
matters, investigating and prosecuting Medi-Cal provider fraud, investigating and prosecuting the abuse or neglect of elder and 
dependent adults residing in long-term health care facilities, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving 
white-collar crime, high-tech/computer/privacy crime, financial crimes against the elderly, human trafficking, environmental 
crimes, and public corruption. 
Public Rights protects and preserves the public interest by providing legal services to state agencies and Constitutional Officers 
and by bringing actions in the name of the Attorney General to protect the public. Public Rights provides specialized services in 
the following areas: Civil Rights Enforcement (including Underground Economy and the Bureau of Children's Justice); 
Charitable Trusts (including the Registry of Charitable Trusts); Natural Resources Law; Corporate Fraud (including False 
Claims, Energy and Corporate Responsibility); Indian and Gaming Law; Environment Law (including Bureau of Environmental 
Justice); Land Law; Consumer Law (including Sellers of Travel and Privacy Enforcement and Protection); Antitrust Law; and 
Tobacco Litigation Enforcement.

LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five elements: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3) 
Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief. 
The Bureau of Firearms provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms and 
ammunitions laws by conducting firearms eligibility background checks and administering over thirty different state-mandated 
firearms-related programs. The Bureau conducts firearms dealer and manufacturer inspections for compliance, and provides 
training as needed. Special Agents conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting 
in the seizure of firearms, magazines, and ammunition. Agents also conduct investigations to monitor and prevent 
illegal firearm trafficking at permitted gun shows in accordance with state and federal laws. 
The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and analysis of physical evidence, including crime scene 
investigation and expert court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts, by 
operating 11 specialized laboratories that serve 46 counties as well as a forensic training facility. BFS maintains the state DNA 
laboratory database which compiles DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees. 
The Bureau of Gambling Control regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted honestly and 
is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of individuals and 
business entities who apply for state gambling licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance 
with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. Furthermore, the Bureau conducts criminal investigations in, on or 
about Tribal casinos and California cardrooms. The Bureau also regulates Tribal gaming to ensure that each Tribe is in 
compliance with all aspects of the negotiated gaming compact. 
The Bureau of Investigation is the premiere investigative agency that is responsible for exploiting and dismantling criminal 
organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses which present a significant and multi-
jurisdictional threat to California. The Bureau prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal organizations involved in 
gangs and human trafficking, as well as cases involving environmental crimes, public corruption, major white-collar fraud, 
underground economy, recycle fraud, foreign prosecution assistance agencies, and high-technology crimes. In addition, the 
Bureau serves a principal role in providing leadership, coordination, and support to law enforcement through multi-agency drug, 
gang and major crimes task forces statewide. 
The Office of the Chief enhances public safety by providing training, technical, and administrative support to the investigative, 
regulatory and forensic components of the Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies. The Office serves 
as the policy-making and oversight body for its four operational bureaus. 
0445 - CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES 
The California Justice Information Services Division provides criminal justice intelligence, information, and identification 
services to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the public. Four major functional areas carry out these primary services: 
1) The Bureau of Criminal Identification & Investigative Services consolidates the identification, investigative, and field services 
functions, providing information and technical assistance on manual and automated systems including the fingerprint 
identification system and the violent crime information system; 2) The Bureau of Criminal Information and Analysis consolidates 
the functions related to the authorization, release, and use of criminal offender record information for law enforcement 
investigatory and regulatory purposes; 3) The Hawkins Data Center operates the Criminal Justice Information System and the 
California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System; and 4) the Operations Support Program provides business 
resumption planning and administrative support and oversight. 
9900 - DIRECTORATE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Directorate and the Administration Division of the Department of Justice consists of the Division of Operations and the 
Attorney General's Executive Office. The executive office maintains overall direction and administration over the diverse 
programs and projects of the department, including the Equal Employment Rights and Resolution Office, the Office of Program 
Oversight and Accountability, the Opinions Unit, the Solicitor General's Unit, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Office of 
Communications and the Public Inquiry Unit. In addition, the Division of Operations provides support functions essential to the 
department's operations, including fiscal, personnel, and specialized services such as legal secretarial support, litigation 
support, and legal case management services.

0845   Department of Insurance 
California's publicly-elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the fourth largest insurance economy in the world with insurers 
collecting more than $310 billion in premiums annually in California while protecting consumers and the integrity, health and 
vitality of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is "Insurance Protection for All 
Californians." CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in their dealings with 
insurers, and using innovation to improve services for insurance producers and consumers. 
The CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, the CDI oversees and licenses 
approximately 1,400 insurance companies and approximately 410,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents, 
brokers, adjusters and bail agents. Additionally, the CDI receives and investigates approximately 200,000 consumer inquiries 
and complaints annually; performs examinations to ensure the financial solvency of companies; receives more than 28,000 
suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually; receives and reviews approximately 7,250 rate filing applications annually; and 
works in conjunction with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute fraudulent insurance 
practices.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0520 - REGULATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCERS 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) prevent losses to policyholders, beneficiaries or the public due to the insolvency of 
insurers, including the review of complex, principles-based reserving methods to avoid reliance on black box models; (2) 
prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurers as defined by the Insurance Code; (3) ensure that property and casualty 
insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the Insurance Code and the 
California Code of Regulations; (4) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and 
attempt to get unreasonable rates lowered by insurers; and (5) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of 
insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Through the Conservation and Liquidation Office, the 
CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies. 
0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders 
and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating or 
underwriting by insurers and (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful or fraudulent practices or 
incompetence relating to the sale of insurance and (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved communities. 
0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 
The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for 
prosecution or adjudication those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed 
by sworn peace officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program also 
implements the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower 
"qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud. 
0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE 
This program performs tax collection; ensures compliance from insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws 
contained in the Insurance Code and Revenue and Taxation Code; and works with California Department of Tax and Fee 
Administration and State Controller's Office with various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the premium 
tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

0850   California State Lottery Commission 
In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an 
initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it 
broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to 
benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by 
the State Senate. 
The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34 
percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be 
used for administrative costs. 
In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost 
limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of 
contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery 
Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily 
Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the 
University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 
In the 33 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2018, the California State Lottery has raised $34.2 billion 
for public education, including $1.7 billion in FY 2017-18. 
Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2018-19 and 2019-20 cannot be made 
with certainty.

0700 - FILINGS AND REGISTRATIONS 
The Business Programs Division is comprised of three primary areas: Business Entities, Uniform Commercial Code, and 
Notary Public and Special Filings. 
Business Entities examines, files, and maintains formation documents for new California business entities and qualifies out-of-
state and international entities to conduct business in California; and also examines, files and maintains changes to the records 
of domestic or qualified foreign business entities to ensure the business entities are properly formed, merged, converted, 
amended, and dissolved in compliance with California law. Statements of Information containing key officers and contact 
information are also processed and maintained for public and governmental use. 
Uniform Commercial Code files certain financing statements allowing lending institutions to protect their financial interest in 
personal property and established priority in case of debtor default or bankruptcy. Notices of judgment liens, attachment liens, 
agricultural liens, and equipment liens are also filed in Uniform Commercial Code, as well as notices of various tax liens 
submitted by state and federal taxing agencies such as the Franchise Tax Board and the Internal Revenue Service. 
Notary Public and Special Filings appoints and commissions qualified notaries public for four- year terms, reviews and 
approves notary public education courses, and certifies to the authenticity of signatures of notaries public and public officials on 
documents for use in foreign countries. Special Filings include trademarks and service marks as well as surety bonds that 
certain business entities are required to file, notices of joint power agreements, city and county charters, and claims for 
successor-in-interest. This area also has disciplinary functions with regard to notaries public and immigration consultants. 
The Advance Health Care Directive (AHCD) Registry maintains AHCDs, which allow a person to indicate his/her medical 
treatment preferences if he/she cannot speak or make decisions for him/herself. The AHCD also may designate someone else 
to make decisions regarding medical treatment. AHCDs and related information can be provided upon request to the 
registrant's health care provider, public guardian, or legal representative. 
The Domestic Partners Registry registers same-sex couples regardless of the age of the partners, and opposite-sex couples in 
which one partner is at least 62 years old, as domestic partners in California. 
The Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund provides limited restitution to victims of corporate fraud who are unable to 
collect through other means on a judgment against a corporation for corporate fraud. 
Safe at Home is a confidential mail forwarding program designed to assist victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, 
sexual assault, stalking, or a reproductive healthcare employee, patient, or volunteer. Participants in the Safe at Home program 
are provided with a free post office box to use as a substitute mailing address, thereby protecting their actual residential 
address. Once enrolled into the program, Safe at Home serves as a liaison for those participants who qualify for additional 
confidential services offered by various state and local agencies.

Reform Act and posts relevant registration and disclosure information to the Office's web site so the public can track where 
campaign money is raised and spent and what lobbying activity is occurring in state government. A searchable database of 
campaign and lobbying financial activity is also provided through the web site.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES 
The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption. 
During the 2017-18 fiscal year, this Division handled 8,573 security investment transactions totaling $392 billion. The Pooled 
Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 6,945 of these transactions totaling $346 billion; time deposits 
accounted for 1,256 transactions totaling $32.2 billion. The remaining $13.8 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special 
funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's 
retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment 
program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the 
2017-18 fiscal year, 2,438 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $21.4 billion for the fiscal year. 
0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 
In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System 
(CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires 
the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB, 
giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits, 
and loans to the General Fund. 
The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of 
the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that 
the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer 
maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for 
the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 
The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts 
available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer 
of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for 
payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities 
pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other 
state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or 
pledged to the state. 
0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE 
The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes, 
revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The 
Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to 
bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 
The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to state debt so there is no adverse consequences to 
bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance for various state debt includes 
monitoring the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial 
disclosure, and ensuring proper record keeping. 
0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 
services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems, 
business services, technical support, and production operations.

0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee 
The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State 
of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit, 
such as the creation of affordable housing. 
The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual 
basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by 
multiplying the state population by $105. California's limit totaled over $4.1 billion in 2018. (California's limit for the Qualified 
Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated separately by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $395 
million for 2018.) 
The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers 
authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state 
or federal government. 
The Committee administers six active programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private 
activity bonds.  The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the 
Governor, or upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
To lower the cost of financing, specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that 
support below-market interest rate mortgage loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that reduce a homebuyer's federal 
2019-20 STATE BUDGET — LJE 228

tax liability. Below is a summary of each program: 
Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost for developers of multifamily 
rental housing to acquire land and construct new housing or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers 
produce affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and 
families. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can apply for non-competitive four-percent tax credits using the 
California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit Allocation Committee Joint Application. 
Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs to assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes. 
Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program 
participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations. 
Home Improvement and Rehabilitation Bond Program - MRBs or MCCs to assist homeowners with home improvement 
financing. Homeowners may improve single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. 
Program participants must meet income limits, and in certain cases, must own a home that falls within the program's 
rehabilitation cost and age-of-home limitations. 
 
Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds 
issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and 
midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their 
communities. 
Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance solid waste disposal and waste recycling 
facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities 
they serve to meet mandated requirements to protect and enhance the environment. 
 
Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance the construction, 
renovation, and furnishing of primary and secondary school facilities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0830 - CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCING ADVISORY COMMISSION 
The core program area is the Industrial Development Bond Program, under which the Commission serves as the mandatory 
approval agency for the local bond issuers. Once potential borrowers (manufacturers and processing companies) apply through 
their local government agency for low cost tax-exempt financing, the Commission carefully reviews the public benefits 
generated by the proposed project, particularly those benefits associated with job creation, and determines whether these 
benefits will significantly outweigh any detrimental public effects. Eligible capital expenditures include the acquisition of land,

building construction, building renovation, and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Bond proceeds also can be used to 
cover the cost of architects, engineers, attorneys, permits, and the cost of bond issuance. The local issuer can be a city, county, 
economic development authority, or a joint power authority. 
Since AB 1547 abolished the California Industrial Development Financing Advisory Commission on September 21, 2018, the 
California Debt Limit Allocation Committee will continue to provide state level oversight of locally issued industrial development 
bonds through its management of the state’s allocation of tax-exempt bonds.

0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee 
The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and 
maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California. The Committee does this by forming 
partnerships with developers, investors and public entities. 
The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years 
after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with income and rent restrictions related to the tax credit programs of the 
Committee. Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private investors, the Committee helps to create 
and maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing. 
The Committee consists of seven members, including three voting members and four advisors. The voting members are the 
Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor (who may choose the Director of Finance as his or her 
representative), and the State Controller. The non-voting (advisory) members are the Director of Housing and Community 
Development, the Executive Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and two local government representatives. 
One local representative is associated with a city government and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The other is a 
county government representative appointed by the Senate Rules Committee.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
The Federal Program 
Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax 
incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise 
project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and 
indexed for inflation. 
Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the 
percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability 
annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of 
the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project 
sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each 
year for a ten-year period. 
The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation.  For 2018, each 
state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.40 per state resident.  Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share 
of unused credits in a national pool. 
Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects 
must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there 
is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. 
Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires 
maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance. 
 
The State LIHTC Program 
In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the 
federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for 
an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax 
credit status. 
The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2018, was $98.6 million. Investors take the state tax credit 
annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period. 
 
Farmworker Housing Program 
Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state 
LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017, 
these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and 
projects may receive state credits even if they receive an increase in their federal tax credit basis.

0971   California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing 
Authority 
The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes 
of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently 
utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the 
environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources, 
implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and 
lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit 
enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities 
needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies. 
The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director 
of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, 
and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the 
authority, bond insurance, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as 
determined and approved by resolution of the Authority. 
In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative 
source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010) and subsequently, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2012, expanded 
the STE program to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 
768, Statutes of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock 
and equipment that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. The objective of this program is to 
promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, 
air and water pollution, and energy consumption. 
Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013 
(Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority 
developed a loan loss reserve program to assist financial institutions in making loans to homeowners in the state for residential 
whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and developed a risk mitigation program for residential Property 
Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. 
Most recently, the Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf 
of, and in collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission. These energy efficiency financing pilot programs will 
employ various types of credit enhancements to encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the residential and 
commercial sectors) for energy efficiency improvements needed to help achieve California's energy efficiency goals.

0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority 
California Pollution Control Financing Authority is committed to stimulating local economies in California by making capital more 
accessible to small businesses, and delivering innovative financing for projects that protect and restore the environment. The 
Authority was created to assist the solid waste, recycling, water, and wastewater industries through its Pollution Control Tax-
Exempt Bond Program. Over the last twenty-five years, the Authority has evolved to provide financing assistance to California's 
small business sector through its California Capital Access Program (CalCAP), and to promote the reuse and redevelopment of 
brownfields through the California Recycle Underutilized Sites Program (CALReUSE). 
The Authority consists of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the State Controller, and the Director of the Department of 
Finance.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM 
The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the 
acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment, 
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
2019-20 STATE BUDGET — LJE 243
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority 
assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989. 
As of June 30, 2018, bonds totaling approximately $15.6 billion have been issued by the Authority. 
0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
The objective of this program is to encourage banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses. CalCAP 
for Small Businesses is a form of loan loss recovery that may provide up to 100 percent coverage on certain loan defaults. By 
participating in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to meet the financing needs of 
California's small businesses. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund for each participating 
financial institution. The Authority funds this reserve together with the financial institution and the borrower. Additional 
incentives are provided to lend to businesses located in specified communities. The reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk, 
allowing banks to lend to targeted California small businesses. Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million General 
Fund to CalCAP to increase lending efforts. As of June 30, 2018, approximately $750,000 of the $6 million remained in the 
State-funded program account to assist small businesses. 
In addition, California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168.6 million from the federal State Small 
Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The Authority and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (Go-BIZ) 
equally share this allocation of $84.3 million each. These funds have enabled the Authority to expand the availability of its 
CalCAP program statewide. The Authority also launched the Collateral Support Program to assist more small businesses and 
utilize the SSBCI federal funds. As of June 30, 2018, the federally-funded program account to assist small businesses under 
the CalCAP loan loss reserve program was fully-expended. Approximately $1 million remained in the federally-funded program 
account for the Collateral Support Program, obligated to pre-approved loans. Funds are being recaptured to sustain both 
programs. 
Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority has partnered with the Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist diesel truck and 
equipment owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $107.3 million in Air Quality Improvement 
Program funds towards the purchase or retrofit of diesel trucks to comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The 
Authority has also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit 
enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers who install electric vehicle charging stations. Similarly, the Authority is 
partnering with the Department of Resources, Recycling, and Recovery to assist with the financing of important state recycling 
objectives. 
0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM 
The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived 
contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of contaminated properties 
(brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program 
provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000, which was later increased to $500,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with 
brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the development of remedial action plans. Eligible 
projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or 
perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process. 
Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund 
brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received 
$60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided up to $5 million per project in loans and grants for the purpose of brownfield 
cleanup that promotes affordable infill residential and mixed-used development. All CALReUSE Program funds have been 
awarded. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will result in 5,618 housing units 
in 30 California communities. 
0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS 
Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative 
energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's 
environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and 
state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority. 
0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES ACT 
The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal 
Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for their employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other 
financial institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the 
Authority an appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the 
CalCAP model and create loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program.

0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM 
The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time 
allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to create an accessible loan program to qualified small businesses and 
residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of 
Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other 
financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the 
program. The loans to small businesses and residential property owners are for financing seismic retrofits of real property to 
reduce losses and mitigate seismic damage.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM 
In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3 
established the second Children's Hospital Program. In 2018, Proposition 4 established a third Children’s Hospital Program. 
The purpose of the three programs is to improve the health and welfare of California's critically ill children by providing a stable 
and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's hospitals. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is 
derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition 
3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4. 
0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES GRANTS AND LOANS 
The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health 
institutions. 
Tax-Exempt Bond Program 
Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt, liability, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power of 
the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for repayment of 
the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation or 
association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district. 
Lifeline Grant Program 
Chapter 52, Statutes of 2017 (SB 97) authorized the Authority to approve grants of up to $20 million dollars from the HELP II 
Loan Program subfund account. The Lifeline Grant Program assists small and rural health facilities, including community-based 
clinics, that may be adversely affected financially by a reduction or elimination of federal government assistance and that have 
little to no access to working capital. Grants must be awarded by June 30, 2020. 
HELP II Loan Program 
 
The Authority administers the Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II (HELP II) to assist small and rural health facilities in 
obtaining financing for their capital needs. The HELP II Program provides two percent and three percent fixed interest rate 
loans of up to $1,500,000 to California's nonprofit small and rural health facilities in an efficient, timely, and cost effective 
manner. HELP II loans may be used to purchase or construct new facilities, remodel or renovate existing facilities, purchase 
equipment and/or furnishings, and refinance existing debt. 
 
California Health Access Model Program 
Chapter 23, Statutes of 2012 (AB 1467) authorized the California Health Access Model Program (CHAMP), a grant program 
intended to support innovative methods of delivering health care services and improve health outcomes for vulnerable 
populations and communities by bringing services to individuals where they live or congregate.

$142.5 million in one-time General Fund, and $4 million in ongoing Mental Health Services Act funding to provide grants for 
community based mental health crisis support, which may also be eligible for matching federal funding. 
The Act established a grant program to disburse funds to California counties or to their nonprofit or public agency designates 
for the purpose of developing mental health crisis support programs. Specifically, funds will increase capacity for client 
assistance and services in crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, crisis residential treatment, rehabilitative mental health 
services, and mobile crisis support teams. The grants will support capital improvement, expansion and limited start-up costs. 
 
Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for Children and Youth 
With the passage of Chapter 30, Statutes of 2016 (SB 833), the Investment in Mental Health Grant Program for Children and 
Youth was created to increase mental health services for children and youth 21 years of age and under to develop a complete 
continuum of crisis services. Working with counties, the program funds facility acquisition, construction/renovation, equipment 
acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs to provide mental health services for children and youth as well as 
provide family respite care throughout the state. 
 
Community Services Infrastructure Grants 
Chapter 33, Statutes of 2016 (SB 843) created the Community Services Infrastructure competitive grant program to expand 
community alternatives to jail and prison. The program seeks to expand access to jail and prison diversion programs and 
services for those with mental health illness, substance use disorders, or who have suffered from trauma. Working with 
counties, the program will fund facility acquisition, renovation, equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs 
for facilities that provide services to this population. 
No Place Like Home Program 
Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home Program (NPLH), which requires the Housing and 
Community Development Agency (HCD) to award up to $2 billion among counties to fund the acquisition, design, construction, 
rehabilitation, or preservation of permanent supportive housing for individuals living with a severe mental illness who are 
homeless or at risk of chronic homelessness. Chapter 322, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1628) authorized CHFFA to enter into 
contracts with HCD and further authorized CHFFA to issue up to $2 billion in taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the NPLH 
Program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD 
On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which 
allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can 
make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings. 
ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability 
expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the 
State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals. 
2019-20 STATE BUDGET — LJE 254
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the 
purpose of creating the Program. Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $15,000 during a taxable year, 
to a designated beneficiary's ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary.

LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 
DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY 
Public Resources Code, Division 22, Sections 32000-32208. 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0900 - The Authority was established to issue up to $650 million in conduit financing to make loans or acquire title to property 
and to underwrite or undertake directly a variety of urban waterfront development projects within the coastal zone, the 
Sacramento-Yolo Port District, the Stockton Port District, and those metropolitan statistical areas meeting specified conditions. 
The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that bonds authorized by the Authority generally be within an allocation from the 
state's ''private activity'' bond limit in order for the bonds to be federally tax-exempt, unless the issuer qualifies as a private, 
nonprofit business. 
Financing is available for both publicly and privately sponsored projects that provide visitor-serving facilities, waterfront-
dependent industries, public recreation, and erosion control facilities. The State Coastal Conservancy must approve both the 
specific project and a master plan for urban waterfront restoration before any project can obtain the Authority approval for 
revenue bond financing. The Authority has sold $3.33 million in revenue bonds to date.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM 
Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance 
of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to schools and 
community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities, 
reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB 
2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs. 
0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM 
Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program 
(CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the 
Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University 
Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50 
percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the 
state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be 
deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements. 
0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM 
In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded grants under the United States Department of Education's State Charter School 
Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs. 
Grant funds reimburse a charter school's costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities 
or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on 
preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, and 
demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. 
0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM 
The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and 
lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged 
students. Eligible charter schools are provided up to $1,187 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, not to exceed 75 
percent of their total annual facilities rent or lease costs. 
0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND 
Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of 
up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is 
available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference is given to schools that 
have not completed their full charter term.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0940 - BOND FINANCING 
CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational 
facilities. Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms 
than might otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the 
construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or 
the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating 
institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private 
activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law. 
For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private 
college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on his or her race or ethnicity, provided that the financing does 
not violate constitutional provisions. 
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
2019-20 STATE BUDGET — LJE 269
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
"Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to 
issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings than 
these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing. 
0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND 
Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the 
tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015, 
added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 
1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax 
credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.
