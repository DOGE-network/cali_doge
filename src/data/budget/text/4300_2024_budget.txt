4300   Department of Developmental Services 
The Department of Developmental Services (Department) is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities 
Services Act for overseeing the coordination and delivery of services and supports that persons with developmental disabilities 
need to lead more independent and productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets 
broad policy and provides leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities and standards within which 
the developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate 
problems that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community 
agencies known as regional centers as well as through state-operated programs. The Department, through contracts with the 
21 regional centers, oversees through audits and other review the coordination of services to persons with developmental 
disabilities; provides that such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each 
stage of their lives; and, to the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community. 
Because the Department’s programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4140 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM 
Through the network of regional centers, the Department contracts with regional centers to support the development and 
maintenance of services for eligible persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers 
directly provide or coordinate the following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis, 
(3) counseling, (4) lifelong individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the 
individual program plan, (6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of 
legal, civil, and service rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning, 
placement, and monitoring for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, 
(12) community education about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services. 
4145 - STATE-OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM 
The Department currently operates two larger residential facilities: Fairview Developmental Center (Orange County), which is in 
warm shutdown, and Porterville Developmental Center (Tulare County). Secure treatment services are provided at the 
Porterville Developmental Center for individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial due to their developmental

disability or are dangerous to themselves or others and civilly committed to the facility by court order. The Department also 
operates Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences in Northern, Central, and Southern 
California to provide acute crisis services in the community. Finally, the Department leases one community facility for persons 
who require specialized behavioral interventions and acute crisis stabilization: Canyon Springs in Cathedral City (Riverside 
County). Under the California Department of Public Health, Porterville Developmental Center is licensed as a General Acute 
Care Hospital and Intermediate Care Facility, and Canyon Springs Community Facility operates as an Intermediate Care 
Facility. 
STAR residences operate as community crisis homes. Services involve the provision of active treatment through residential 
and day programs on a 24-hour basis, including appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, and 
assistance with activities of daily living, training, education, and employment. 
Individuals served in the STAR crisis residences are committed by a court order to the Department for suitable treatment and 
habilitation services during a crisis and are provided services and supports necessary to prepare them for return to their home 
or to transition to a new living option. The primary objective of this program is to provide a safety net of services that include 
providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents based upon assessed need and as outlined in 
each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most efficient, effective, and least restrictive manner 
to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system and are designed to teach individuals the skills for 
increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and welfare, and enhance personal competence in 
all areas of daily living. 
4149 - PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of this program is to: (1) provide overall management, planning and policy development, legal, legislative, audit, 
and administrative services; (2) manage revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state programs, insurance 
companies, and private payers; (3) monitor regional center operations for compliance with statute, regulations, and their 
contract with the Department; (4) provide central administrative and clinical management services to the state-operated 
programs to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with state licensing and federal certification requirements, 
protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility structures and grounds; and (5) oversee areas that include the 
development of policies and procedures for developmental center operations, law enforcement and protective services, 
population management, program and fiscal oversight, and facility planning and support.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of facilities under its control, 
including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities 
are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County.

2024-25 GOVERNOR'S BUDGET — HHS 9
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet on 784 acres. As of February 2020, 
the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former residents to community 
living. The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until disposition of the property. 
The Department is projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences that 
provide acute crisis services in the community. Additionally, the Department is responsible for the maintenance of interior 
finishes and equipment at Canyon Springs, a 57,000-square-foot leased facility in Riverside County. These facilities support the 
Department's mission in providing medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision; education; and vocational 
training for residents with developmental disabilities committed to a state-operated facility.
