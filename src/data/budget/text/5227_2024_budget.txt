5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and technical 
assistance necessary to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships within California's adult and juvenile criminal 
justice systems, and to promote legal and safe conditions for youth, the incarcerated, and staff in local detention facilities. This 
mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, intervention, suppression, 
and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with the integrated 
statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for managing 
criminal justice populations. The Board seeks to ensure that its efforts are systematically informed by experts and stakeholders 
with subject matter expertise. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation jointly 
administer several programs to partially finance the design and construction of county correctional facilities. The programs 
consist of Adult Local Criminal Justice and Local Youth Offender Rehabilitation facilities. Legislation is comprised of the 2007 
Senate Bill 81 (Youth), the 2007 Assembly Bill 900 (Adult), the 2012 Senate Bill 1022 (Adult), the 2014 Senate Bill 863 (Adult), 
and the 2016 Senate Bill 844 (Adult). Approximately $294 million has been awarded to 19 counties to build or remodel Youth 
Offender facilities and approximately $2.158 billion has been awarded to 54 counties to build or remodel Adult Local Criminal 
facilities. BSCC oversees 31 of these projects totaling approximately $958 million authorized from Senate Bill 1022, Senate Bill 
863, and Senate Bill 844.
