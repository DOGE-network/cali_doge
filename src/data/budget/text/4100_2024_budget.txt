• Advocacy services through volunteers recruited by Council staff for individuals who have no legally appointed representative 
to assist them in making choices and decisions. 
• Clients' rights advocacy services to ensure that laws, regulations, and policies pertaining to the rights of persons with 
developmental disabilities are observed. 
• Quality Assessments for individuals who receive community residential services and support. 
• Other efforts and projects related to self-determination and supported decision-making.
