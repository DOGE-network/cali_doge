Department of Aging
The Department of Aging's mission is to promote the independence and well-being of older adults, adults with disabilities, and
families through:
•
Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives,
•
Opportunities for community involvement,
•
Support to family members providing care, and
•
Collaboration with other state and local agencies.
As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that
provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and
Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that operate
the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies Community-
Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid.
The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the
local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults
with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
3890 - NUTRITION
The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally-balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60
years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the
isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and
assistance, employment, and education.
3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE
The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized
training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also
promotes transition to unsubsidized employment.

Department of Aging - Continued
2018-19 STATE BUDGET — HHS 27
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers,
grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance,
legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term
Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support
necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care
services appropriate to their needs.
3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS
This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides
personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local
source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans.
3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS
This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services
(CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age or over who
are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or disabilities. The
Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-
based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term
care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility.

CHIP Reauthorization—In February 2018, the federal government approved a ten-year extension of enhanced federal
funding at 88 percent through September 30, 2019, phasing down in future years to the historic ratio of 65 percent.
•
ACA Optional Expansion—In January of each year, the state’s cost-sharing ratio for the 3.9 million Californians in the
optional Medi-Cal expansion increases incrementally until it reaches 10 percent in 2020. The Budget includes $18.7 billion
($1.7 billion General Fund), an increase of $803.2 million ($251 million General Fund) compared to 2017-18 for the optional
expansion population.
•
Elimination of State-Only Limits on Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment—The Budget includes $8.4 million General Fund
to eliminate the 18-month treatment limitation for breast cancer and 24-month treatment limitation for cervical cancer in the
state-only Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program.

development of Health Information Exchanges to facilitate data sharing of health information between health systems. It also

Department of Public Health
The California Department of Public Health (Public Health) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all
Californians through the following core activities:
•
Protecting the public from communicable diseases.
•
Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments.
•
Preventing disease, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities.
•
Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies.
•
Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status, inform people, institutions and communities; and to
guide public health strategies, programs, and actions.
•
Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces.
•
Providing access to quality, population-based health services.
Because Public Health's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

Department of Developmental Services
The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for
providing persons with developmental disabilities the services and supports they need to lead more independent and
productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy and provides
leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities, standards, and procedures within which the
developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems
that arise. Services are delivered directly through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community
agencies known as regional centers as well as through developmental centers and a state-operated community facility. The
Department, through the 21 private, nonprofit regional centers, oversees coordination of services to persons with
developmental disabilities; provides that such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these
individuals at each stage of their lives; and, to the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home
community.
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

supply of vendors; a comparison of the fiscal effects of alternative rate setting methods; and how vendor rates relate to
consumer outcomes.

Health, Intermediate Care Facility-Developmentally Disabled, and Pediatric Day Health Care providers. This adjustment is
consistent with increases provided in the Department of Health Care Services, Medi-Cal program.
•

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
4140 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM
Through the network of regional centers, the Department supports the development and maintenance of services for eligible
persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers directly provide or coordinate the
following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis, (3) counseling, (4) lifelong
individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the individual program plan,
(6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of legal, civil, and service
rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning, placement, and monitoring
for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, (12) community education
about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services.
4145 - STATE-OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM
The Department operates three residential facilities: Fairview Developmental Center (Orange County), Porterville
Developmental Center (Tulare County), and Sonoma Developmental Center (Sonoma County). Secure treatment services are
provided at the Porterville Developmental Center. The Department also leases one small community facility for persons who
require specialized behavioral interventions: Canyon Springs, a 63-bed facility in Cathedral City (Riverside County). The
residential facilities are licensed as General Acute Care Hospitals with distinct parts for skilled nursing care and intermediate
care. Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility only. Services at all facilities involve the provision of active
treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis, including appropriate medical and dental care, health
maintenance activities, and assistance with activities of daily living, training, education, and employment.
Beginning in 2018-19, the Department will operate four Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR)
residences that provide acute crisis services in the community. Individuals served in the STAR residences are committed by a
court order to the Department for suitable treatment and habilitation services, and are provided services and supports
necessary to prepare them for return to their residential home or to transition to a new living option.
The primary objectives of this program include providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents
based upon assessed need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most
efficient, effective, and least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system; and
are designed to teach individuals skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and
welfare, and enhance personal competence in all areas of daily living.
The Developmental Centers Division provides central administrative and clinical management services to the three
developmental centers and the leased small community facility to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with
state licensing and federal certification requirements, protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility structures
and grounds. Areas of responsibility include the development of policy and procedures for all aspects of the developmental
centers operations, law enforcement and protective services, facility population management, program and fiscal oversight, and
facilities planning and support.

Department of State Hospitals
The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is
to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, seeking innovation and excellence in state hospital
operations, across a continuum of care. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health
treatment for its patients in five state hospitals, and employs nearly 11,000 staff. Additionally, the Department provides services
in jail-based competency treatment programs and conditional release programs throughout the 58 counties. In 2016-17, State
Hospitals served approximately 13,000 patients, with an average daily inpatient census of approximately 7,000; and the jail-
based competency programs served approximately 700 patients, with a daily capacity of around 200 beds. The conditional
release program maintains an average daily census of approximately 650.
The Department oversees five state hospitals, located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and Patton.
The psychiatric programs treating mentally-ill prisoners, operating at Vacaville, Salinas Valley, and Stockton state prisons, were
transferred to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation as of July 1, 2017. The Department continues to
designate 336 beds at Atascadero, Coalinga, and Patton state hospitals for the treatment of mentally-ill Coleman class
prisoners.
Because the Department of State Hospitals' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure
Overview."

Forensic and Evaluation Services is comprised of the Mentally Disordered Offender and the Sex Offender Commitment
Programs. Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of
Prison Terms to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs evaluations
to determine if individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the Mentally Disordered Offender program. These evaluations are
used by the Board of Parole Hearings in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of State Hospitals as a
condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995) was enacted January
1, 1996, establishing a new category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to be sexually violent
predators. The Sex Offender Commitment Program administers clinical screenings and performs evaluations to determine if
prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for a sexually violent predator commitment to the Department of State Hospitals upon
completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the ultimate determination whether an individual is likely to be a sexually
violent predator and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the Department of State Hospitals.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
Triage Personnel Grant Program—The Budget includes a reduction of $12 million from the Mental Health Services Fund in
the Triage Personnel Grant Program to reflect the Commission’s historic level of grant expenditures. This reduction allows
for a portion of the funds to be reinvested for other ongoing mental health purposes, including suicide hotlines.
•
Immigrant and Refugee Mental Health—The Budget includes $670,000 ongoing from the Mental Health Services Fund for
the Commission to provide stakeholder advocacy contracts that support mental health outreach and services for immigrant
and refugee populations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS
The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through
financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services.
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households
to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related
emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard
the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which
supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used
along with LIHEAP weatherization related services.
The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-
income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants.
The Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Program provides services to fully abate or control lead paint hazards in low-income
privately owned housing with young children.
The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides weatherization and renewable energy services in low-income
single-family and multi-family dwellings within disadvantaged communities to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LIWP
includes projects such as weatherization and solar water heater and solar photovoltaic systems installations.
4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES
The Community Services Block Grant is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community organizations to
help low-income families achieve and maintain self-sufficiency through a broad range of activities. These activities include
education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional
services. Additionally, Community Services Block Grant funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-
income communities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES
The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities through
vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state. In addition, the Department
has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (education, mental health, and welfare) to provide services to
consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process, which gives priority to persons with the most
significant disabilities.
Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range of
services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, and
independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their communities.
The Department provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to enable persons who are blind or visually
impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias. Prevocational services are
provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to newly blind adults to prepare them for vocational rehabilitation services and
independent living.
The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation
services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and
establishes fees for services provided to its consumers.
The Department works with the federal government to administer two grant programs. The Promoting the Readiness of Minors
in Supplemental Security Income grant develops projects to promote positive outcomes for children who receive Supplemental
Security Income and their families. The CA Innovations Program seeks to increase the self-sufficiency of students with
disabilities by providing work-based learning experiences and planned education to prepare them for workplace success.
4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES
The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout
California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently and be
productive in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, benefits advocacy,
independent living skills development, housing assistance, personal assistance services, transition services to community
based living, transition services to postsecondary life for youth, and personal and systems change advocacy.
The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their
families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons with
TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for
family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community.
The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 19 non-profit community-based
organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually
impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low
vision training, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, independent living
skills development, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services.
9900 - ADMINISTRATION
The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services
to departmental programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM
The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing
parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and
enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-
D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families block grant.
4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION:
The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating
expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The
federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs.
4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION:
Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal
certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State
Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts
and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support
Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments
from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program
provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
End SSI Cash-Out—The Budget includes one-time funding of $230 million General Fund to eliminate the SSI cash-out policy
no later than August 1, 2019, expanding federal funding for food assistance while holding harmless households potentially
affected by the change. Prior to this change, SSI individuals did not receive CalFresh benefits and their income was not
counted in the benefit calculations in a CalFresh household. These individuals instead were given a $10 monthly
supplemental SSI/SSP benefit. Elimination of this policy results in approximately 370,000 households becoming newly
eligible for CalFresh benefits, with an additional 45,000 households receiving an increase in CalFresh benefits.
•
Home Visiting Initiative—The Budget includes $26.7 million for a voluntary CalWORKs Home Visiting pilot program, which
will provide pregnant women and families with a child under the age of two with home visitation services for up to 24 months,
with priority given to first-time pregnant women and parents. The goal of the home visiting pilot is to help young families
reach self-sufficiency by improving family engagement practices, supporting healthy development of young children living in
poverty, and preparing parents for employment. The pilot will leverage existing, evidence-based program models currently
being implemented across the state. A total of $131.6 million in one-time federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
block grant funds is being reserved for the pilot's total costs through calendar year 2021.
•
CalWORKs Grant Increase—The Budget increases CalWORKs grant levels by 10 percent, beginning April 1, 2019, with
General Fund costs of $90.1 million in 2018-19 and $359.9 million annually thereafter. This increase will bring grant levels to
45 percent of the federal poverty level. Additional increases may be considered beyond 2018-19 until grant levels reach at
least 50 percent of the federal poverty level. Any such increases would be subject to an appropriation of funds.
•
CalWORKs Single Allocation Methodology—Compared to the 2017 Budget Act, the Budget includes an increase of $55.8
million TANF in 2018-19 to reflect the adoption of a revised budgeting methodology for county administration of the
CalWORKs eligibility determination process. This model recognizes that counties have difficulty adjusting to significant
increases and decreases in caseload, and attempts to smooth out the changes to county funding. The methodology: (1)
establishes a fixed-base funding level that does not adjust when caseload changes, and (2) includes a variable component
that adjusts when caseload increases or decreases by 5 percent or more, compared to the 2018-19 caseload. An additional
one-time $23.5 million General Fund is included for Employment Services, effectively holding the total 2018-19 Single
Allocation level to the 2017 Budget Act level. The Administration intends to evaluate the budgeting methodology for the
Employment Services during 2019-20 budget development.
•
Safety Net Reserve—The Budget establishes a Safety Net Reserve Fund for CalWORKs and Medi-Cal to maintain program
services and benefits in economic downturns. The Budget includes an initial transfer of $200 million from the General Fund
to the Safety Net Reserve Fund, CalWORKs Subaccount. The Department of Finance, in consultation with DSS, DHCS, and
the Legislative Analyst’s Office, will present a methodology to the Legislature to determine future transfers to and
distributions from the fund.
•
IHSS County Administration—The Budget includes $51.8 million General Fund for county IHSS administrative costs in
2018-19. The increased funding reflects revised IHSS workload assumptions developed in consultation with representatives
of counties. The Budget includes an additional one-time augmentation of $15.4 million General Fund for county
administration.
•
Services to Address Homelessness—The Budget includes an augmentation of $24.2 million in 2018-19 to help CalWORKs
families secure permanent housing, increasing total funding from $47 million to $95 million annually beginning in 2019-20;
increases the daily payment rate for temporary housing assistance from $65 to $85, effective January 1, 2019, with costs of
$8.1 million in 2018-19 and $15.3 million annually thereafter; and provides one-time funding of $15 million General Fund to
establish a three-year pilot program, with local matching funds, designed to provide housing-related supports to seniors
experiencing or at risk of homelessness.
•
IHSS Provider Paid Sick Leave—The Budget includes $29.3 million General Fund to reflect implementation of eight paid sick
leave hours for IHSS providers beginning on July 1, 2018. Accrued paid sick leave hours will increase to 16 hours and 24
hours annually when the state minimum hourly wage reaches $13 and $15, respectively. General Fund costs are projected
to grow to $131.2 million by 2022-23.
•
Immigration Services—The Budget includes a total of $65 million General Fund, including one-time funding of $17 million, for
the Immigration Services Program to provide a broad array of legal services and remedies for individuals and families related
to immigration status. The one-time funds will be used primarily to benefit unaccompanied undocumented minors and other
minors in removal proceedings, current and past beneficiaries of federal temporary protected status, and persons on
California State University campuses. The Budget also includes $10 million one-time Proposition 98 General Fund to provide

immigration legal services to students on California Community College campuses, as well as a one-time augmentation of $4
million General Fund to provide legal services for persons on a University of California campus. Together, the Budget
provides $79 million General Fund for immigration services in 2018-19, and $48 million ongoing thereafter.
•
Foster Care Support—The Budget includes various increases to support foster youth and their caregivers, including: (1)
$13.4 million TANF to provide caregivers with up to six months of emergency assistance payments pending approval as a
resource family, (2) $16.8 million General Fund to eliminate the backlog of foster care resource family applications and
support the implementation of a tool to assess a child’s needed level of care, and (3) $4 million General Fund related to
expanding eligibility for Chafee education and training voucher grant awards to former foster youth up to age 26.
•
Community Care Licensing—The Budget includes $26.2 million federal Child Care and Development block grant funds for
the next two years to ultimately achieve annual inspections for licensed child care facilities.
•
Diaper Bank Investment—The Budget includes one-time funding of $10 million General Fund to establish a Diaper Bank
Support Initiative, which will provide funding to specified food banks to purchase diapers for distribution to low-income
families with infants and toddlers.
•
CalFresh Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Program—The Budget includes one-time funding of $9 million General Fund for the
provision of grants to governmental agencies and non-profit entities to run pilot programs that provide supplemental
CalFresh benefits to recipients who purchase fruits and vegetables.
•
Food Bank Infrastructure Improvements—The Budget includes one-time funding of $5.5 million General Fund for California
Food banks to invest in modern refrigerated transportation, cold storage, and other capital improvement projects.
•
Deaf Access Program—The Budget includes an ongoing $4 million General Fund augmentation to the Deaf Access
Program, increasing the program’s total budget to $8.8 million ($6.5 million General Fund) in 2018-19 and annually
thereafter.
•
Holocaust Survivor Assistance—The Budget includes one-time funding of $3.6 million General Fund to provide specialized
services to holocaust survivors and their caregivers that help them remain independent and safe in their communities.
•
Youth and Family Civic Engagement Pilot Program—The Budget includes one-time funding of $2 million General Fund to
establish the Youth and Family Civic Engagement Pilot Program to increase civic participation among low-income youth to
improve community development.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS
The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support
themselves. These programs are comprised of five components:
•
California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs)
•
Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food
Assistance Programs
•
Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program
•
County Administration and Automation Projects
•
Disaster Relief
The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to
enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor,
administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services.
4270010 - CalWORKs:
The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is
California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic
needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes
specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet
these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs
recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Stage One is administered by the
Department of Social Services. Stages Two and Three are administered by the California Department of Education. Parents
have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs
families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and
development services.
4270019 - Other Assistance Payments:
The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term
residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as
a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is
administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social
Services as authorized by federal and state law. The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to
relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system.
The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate
the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in
accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and
state law.
California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs:
•
The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States
provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs.
•
The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and
independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States
unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the
minor.
•
The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human
trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are
available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under
CalWORKs).
The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of
nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of
purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations
eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits
due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.

The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in
employment and training activities.
The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution
to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for
household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with
food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a
state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses.
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious
supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity
Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services
on October 1, 2016.
4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program:
The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled
persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a
State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who
determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients.
4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects:
Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who
administer public assistance programs.
Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services.
4270046 - Disaster Relief:
The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have
suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance
programs.
4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING
The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child
welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and
procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of
the service delivery system.
4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services:
The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in
their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who
either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs
that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option,
and IHSS-Residual Program.
4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing:
The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse
Prevention.
Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and
prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated
services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with
the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and
least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from
foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.
In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter
773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to change
out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment and case
planning.
The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and
private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for
children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services

include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents;
training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For
independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the
biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice.
The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and
sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and
services for at risk families and their children.
The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of physical and financial abuse and
neglect or exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary.
The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health
and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes
facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components.
4275028 - Special Programs:
The Special Programs provides funds for Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance, Access Assistance to the
Deaf, Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services and Legal Services for Unaccompanied and
Undocumented Minors.
4280 - TITLE IV-E WAIVER
The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California. This project provides
participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state foster care
maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable.
4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES
The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and
provide administrative services to other agencies.
4285010 - Disability Evaluation:
The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents
applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of
the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and
overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.
4285019 - Services to Other Agencies:
In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative
services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human
Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public
information services.
9900 - ADMINISTRATION

State-Local Realignment, 1991
In the 1991-92 fiscal year, State-Local Program Realignment restructured the state-county partnership by giving counties
increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment
provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT
The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve
improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability
for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage
cost-effective approaches to providing services.
Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues.
Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts
are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified
in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to
ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision
ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for
county health and social services programs.

2011 State-Local Realignment
Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a
dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility.
Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services,
and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is
appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and
technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at
less cost.
The funding sources for realignment are:
•
The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax.
•
The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues.
Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts:
•
Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services)
•
Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care;
Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment)
•
Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs)
•
Trial Court Security Subaccount
•
Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and
Adult Parole)
•
Community Corrections Subaccount
•
District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount
•
Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant
Special Account)
The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on
statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures.
Note the $4.9 billion in 2017-18 and $5.1 billion in 2018-19 shown below reflect the Health and Human Services public safety
programs. This display does not reflect the funding for the non-Health and Human Services public safety programs. For the full
list of funding in 2011 Realignment, refer to the special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate."
