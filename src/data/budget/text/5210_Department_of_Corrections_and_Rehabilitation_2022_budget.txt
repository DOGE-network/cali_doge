MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Adult Incarcerated and Parolee Population—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the adult incarcerated average 
daily population is projected to decrease by 13,882 in 2021-22 and 10,540 in 2022-23, to a total of 99,590 and 102,932, 
respectively. The 2021-22 decline is primarily due to actions taken to reduce the prison population in response to the 
COVID-19 Pandemic, and the 2022-23 decline is due to anticipated reductions to intake in comparison to the 2021 Budget 
Act assumption. Compared to 2021 Budget Act projections, the average daily parolee population is projected to decrease by 
842 in 2021-22, followed by a decrease by 4,220 parolees in 2022-23, totaling 53,373 and 49,495, respectively. The decline 
in 2022-23 is related to an overall decrease in the incarcerated population and shorter parole terms. When compared to the 
projected average daily population at the 2021 Budget Act, these changes result in a decrease of $102.9 million General 
Fund in 2021-22, and a decrease of $100.6 million General Fund in 2022-23. 
• Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) Population—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the 2022 Budget Act estimates 
an average daily population of 641 youth in 2021-22 and 430 youth in 2022-23, which represents an increase of 28 youth in 
2021-22 and a decrease of 183 youth in 2022-23. Consistent with Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823), and Chapter 18, 
Statutes of 2021 (SB 92), DJJ is scheduled to close on June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Budget reflects a decrease of $4.2 
million General Fund in 2021-22 and a decrease of $25.8 million in 2022-23. 
• Adult Medical and Pharmaceutical Programs—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the population utilized for the 
purposes of the Medical Classification Model is projected to decrease by 5,457 in 2021-22, and decrease by 3,187 in 
2022-23, for totals of 96,270 and 98,540, respectively. Based on the current Medical Classification Model staffing ratios, 
these changes will result in a decrease of $5 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $1.3 million General Fund in 2022-23. 
Based on current pharmaceutical cost projections, the Budget also includes decreases of $14.9 million General Fund in 
2021-22 and $17.9 million General Fund in 2022-23. 
• Mental Health Program—Compared to the 2021 Budget Act projections, the population requiring outpatient mental health 
treatment is projected to increase by 2,694 in 2021-22 and 3,838 in 2022-23, for totals of 30,798 and 31,942, respectively. 
These changes result in increases of $19.8 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $28.6 million General Fund in 2022-23.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4500 - CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Corrections and Rehabilitation Administration program is to provide policy direction, accountability, 
administrative oversight, and support for the overall success of all adult and juvenile correctional and rehabilitation programs. 
The program consists of the Office of the Secretary; Legislative Affairs; Public and Employee Communications; Internal Affairs; 
Audits and Court Compliance; Victim and Survivor Rights and Services; Support Services; Enterprise Information Services; 
Labor Relations, Regulations and Policy; Research; Legal Affairs; Leasing and Facility Management; Appeals; and the Office of 
the Ombudsman. 
4505 - PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT 
The Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development program is responsible for planning, organizing, analyzing, and 
managing peace officer selection through the recruitment, application, testing, background investigation, and medical/
psychological screening processes. The program is also responsible for academy training and employee development for all 
departmental staff. 
4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES 
The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services 
provided by the Department of Justice to CDCR. 
4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS 
The Department accepts commitments from California courts when the person to be committed meets age requirements, can 
materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there are adequate facilities available to care for the individual. 
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and 
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility 
operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, incarcerated youth intake and court services, population 
management services, facility maintenance, and maintains incarcerated youth master files. This program currently oversees 
operations for three facilities and one conservation camp. 
Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 
release planning for each incarcerated youth. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based 
treatment programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption 
therapy, sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp 
programs, and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior 
and reduce recidivism and relapse. 
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the 
California Education Authority. Its mission is to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and 
knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release. 
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State 
Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education, 
English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for 
work experience. 
4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program is to provide medical, dental, and mental health care consistent 
with adopted standards for the quality and scope of services within a custodial environment. The program strives to achieve 
this mission by providing cost-effective, timely, and competent care. In addition, Juvenile Health Care Services is responsible 
for overseeing and implementing the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model, which uses evidence-based principles of a 
cognitive behavioral treatment program to guide the development of the best program for the unique needs of the youth and 
young adult population. 
4530 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - GENERAL SECURITY 
CDCR is required by statute to accept convicted felons from California courts when their sentence is imprisonment in a state 
correctional facility. The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - General Security program is to 
provide safe and secure detention facilities to protect public safety. This program consists of 33 correctional institutions, three 
of which have reception centers, one leased facility, and 34 conservation camps. The Deuel Vocational Institution closed on

September 30, 2021. This program also identifies custody overtime expenditures associated with housing, guarding, and 
transporting incarcerated people. 
4540 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INMATE SUPPORT 
The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Inmate Support program is to provide necessary services 
to incarcerated people such as feeding, clothing, record keeping, and classification assessments at 33 correctional institutions, 
three of which have reception centers, one leased facility, and 34 conservation camps. The camps perform public conservation 
projects including, but not limited to, forest fire prevention, watershed management, and soil conservation. The Deuel 
Vocational Institution closed on September 30, 2021. 
4545 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - CONTRACTED FACILITIES 
The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Contracted Facilities program is to provide meaningful 
rehabilitative programs in the least restrictive housing to prepare for successful reintegration back to the community. These 
facilities are the Community Correctional Facilities, Community Reentry Facilities, and Community Prisoner Mother Program. 
The final Community Correctional Facility closed on May 30, 2021. 
4550 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INSTITUTION ADMINISTRATION 
The Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Institution Administration program is responsible for the management 
and operation of 33 adult institutions, three of which have reception centers, one leased facility, and 34 conservation camps. 
The Deuel Vocational Institution closed on September 30, 2021. The program is responsible for improving institution 
programming and operations. This program is also responsible for providing facility maintenance, asset management, and 
construction services for CDCR's adult facilities and other closed properties. In addition, the Office of Correctional Safety 
facilitates institution and public safety via security threat group management, escapee apprehension, major criminal 
investigations, and critical incident response training. 
4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION 
The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and 
degree of successful reintegration and release to society of incarcerated people paroled from state prison. The program is 
responsible for providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The 
main components of supervision utilize the California Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model, which incorporates 
evidence-based practices into the Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies to elicit long-term behavioral 
change to reduce recidivism. Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case 
factors related to the incarcerated person's risk and current service needs. Case supervision, reassessment, and 
reclassification are regularly scheduled based on parolee behavior and stability in the community. Other components of 
supervision include the Sex Offender Management Program, which incorporates the containment model strategy as required by 
statute, and Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring for all sex offenders. 
The other integral program component is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and 
services in each prison and includes the identification of parolee needs to match them with state and local programs to support 
successful transition into local communities. 
4560 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS 
Rehabilitative Programs and Parole Operations - Adult Community Based Programs utilize a variety of rehabilitative and 
reentry assistance programs designed to promote successful reintegration of parolees while protecting public safety. These 
programs include, but are not limited to, referrals and linkages to Transitional and Emergency Housing, and Day Reporting 
Centers. Other services include enrollment into Pre-Employment and Transitional Work Programs, Cognitive Behavioral 
Treatment and interventions, Substance Use Disorder Treatment, and other wraparound services. The program includes a full 
continuum of transitional programs, including the Transitional Case Management Program and sex offender treatment for all 
sex offenders on parole. 
The program also provides mental health services and treatment to parolees through CDCR's community-based Behavioral 
Health Reintegration program, which provides transitional mental health treatment, case management and crisis intervention. 
The objective of these services is to reduce gaps in treatment after release from incarceration pending sustainable linkage to 
alternative service providers and necessary resources in the community. 
4565 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT ADMINISTRATION 
The Parole Operations - Adult Administration provides administration and support functions such as business services, 
contracts, budgeting, and personnel for all programs and staff. The program also includes the leasing of office space, internet/
data infrastructure, and utilities for the parole units throughout the state. Also in this program, separate from the Division of 
Adult Parole Operations, the Office of Correctional Safety investigates and apprehends fugitive parolees suspected of 
committing serious or violent crimes.

State Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders Committee is to select and train providers on the best evidence-
based risk assessment tools in the treatment of sex offenders. 
4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS 
The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and 
decisions, and to provide the required due process to incarcerated persons throughout the hearing process. 
The Board conducts parole suitability hearings for a variety of incarcerated persons sentenced to lengthy prison terms to 
determine if they should be released from prison.  These hearings include individuals sentenced to life with the possibility of 
parole once they have served a certain amount of time based on the sentence; incarcerated persons sentenced to life with the 
possibility of parole for a nonviolent offense under an alternative sentencing scheme, such as the state’s Three Strikes Law, 
once they have served a certain amount of time based on their commitment offense; incarcerated persons who were under the 
age of 26 at the time of their offense, who have served a minimum of 15, 20, or 25 years of continuous incarceration, 
depending on the sentence, and who are eligible for an incarcerated youth hearing; and incarcerated persons eligible for the 
Elderly Parole Program. 
The Board also conducts medical parole hearings, hearings for certain parole violators, and determines whether parolees 
should be discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for offenders with mental health disorders and sexually violent 
predators, and subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of State Hospitals for mental health treatment. In 
addition, at the Governor's request, the Board investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons, reprieves 
and commutations of sentence, including those involving the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court 
that an incarcerated person’s sentence be recalled due to the incarcerated person’s significant health condition. 
For incarcerated youth, the Board of Juvenile Hearings is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from 
the jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Justice to the jurisdiction of the committing court, and disciplinary appeals.

5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and 
technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal 
justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety 
Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, 
intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is 
consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based 
strategies for managing criminal justice populations. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

5420   Prison Industry Authority 
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 
in a manner similar to private industry. CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee, 
the Secretary of the California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the 
Speaker of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by 
the Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the 
Board. 
CALPIA supports the public safety mission of CDCR by producing incarcerated individuals that have job skills, good work 
habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. CALPIA's work 
programs also help CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative programming for incarcerated individuals. 
CALPIA has three statutory objectives: (1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 
provide work opportunities for incarcerated individuals under the jurisdiction of CDCR; (2) create and maintain working 
conditions within enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure incarcerated individuals assigned 
therein the opportunity to work productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational 
skills; and (3) operate work programs for incarcerated individuals that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient 
funds from the sale of products and services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by 
CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its operation. CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.

(2019-20: $997 and $887 respectively; 2020-21: $2,454 and $3,532 respectively). These are not costs incurred by 
CALPIA—rather, they represent a future liability earned by CALPIA employees in the respective fiscal years.
2/ Prior to FY 2020-21, "Lump Sum Payouts" were recorded at cost center level. This category is now recorded 
under "Selling & Administrative Expenses".
