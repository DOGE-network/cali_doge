Environmental 
Protection 
California Environmental Protection Agency 
programs reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
restore and protect environmental quality, and 
protect public health. The Secretary coordinates 
the state's environmental regulatory programs and 
provides fair and consistent enforcement of 
environmental law. 
3900   Air Resources Board 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air 
pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for 
Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40 
percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 
32). The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's 
most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with air 
pollution control districts, the business community, scientists, community representatives and other stakeholders to implement 
its programs. 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Air Resources Board has 58 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 57 sites are occupied through 
lease, permit, or license agreements. Of the non state-owned sites, 35 support air-monitoring stations and 22 sites support an 
array of vehicle testing, research, planning, enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs; 
some of the support sites are also equipped with an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air 
Resources Board oversees to support its statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's 
exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air 
Resources Board leadership role related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3540 - PESTICIDE PROGRAMS 
 
Pesticide Programs protect California residents and the environment from adverse pesticide impacts with particular emphasis 
on the protection of children, vulnerable populations, and communities. Specific activities include: 
• Evaluating whether to register pesticide products for sale or use in California. 
• Assessing human health and environmental (air, water quality, and wildlife) risks from pesticides. 
• Examining, licensing, and certifying individuals and businesses that recommend, perform, or supervise pest control. 
• Collecting pesticide use data and evaluating use trends. 
• Monitoring pesticide residues in fresh produce, air, and water, as well as occupational settings. 
• Protecting surface and groundwater from pesticide movement through evaluation, prevention, and mitigation. 
• Protecting non-target wildlife from pesticide risks. 
• Reevaluating and mitigating human health and environmental hazards from pesticides. 
• Overseeing local enforcement of pesticide laws and regulations by County Agricultural Commissioners. 
• Ensuring pesticide products sold in the marketplace are registered and meet state health, environmental, and safety 
standards, and that sellers comply with mill assessment responsibilities. 
• Promoting the development and adoption of reduced risk pest management practices through outreach, incentives, and 
grants.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM 
The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund 
program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,259 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups, 
and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 238 sites where the cleanup process is complete. 
Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 1,066 land-use restrictions in 
place on properties throughout the state. 
New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other 
previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to 
return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties, 
abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military 
installations. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Site, a federal Superfund site and former 
hazardous waste disposal site. 
2021-22 STATE BUDGET — EP 54
3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The program works with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and other state agencies to assure response readiness 
for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous waste spills 
and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories. 
3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT 
The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of 
hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at 
100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous 
waste, approximately 5,000 federally-regulated generators, over 70,000 state-regulated generators, and approximately 300 
facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial 
assurance resources, and supports and oversees 81 local agencies implementing the hazardous waste program elements of 
the Unified Program. 
The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including 
electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste 
requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused 
enforcement initiatives. The program also enforces compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste 
and used oil. 
3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS 
The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program compels manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to toxic 
chemicals. The SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products by eliminating or reducing their use of hazardous 
chemicals which may harm people or the environment. The SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in 
products in order to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product 
manufacturers for the analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program 
encourages the adoption of "green chemistry" practices. 
3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY 
The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) 
in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified 
Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for 
owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; the underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response 
plans and inventories; the California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements 
pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories. 
3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM 
The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees removal and remedial actions in the communities 
surrounding the former Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the program, the 
department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including residences, schools, daycare 
centers, and parks within a 1.7-mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated soil at those properties with 
the highest levels of lead in soil and greatest potential for exposure. 
3650 - BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY 
The Board of Environmental Safety is a five-member board that will set fees through regulations, hear hazardous waste permit 
appeals, and provide strategic guidance to the department. The board also contains an Ombudsperson who will serve as a 
resource to the public and the regulated community. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce management, 
information management, and business services. The program also provides legal counsel, external communication, analytical 
chemistry support, environmental justice and tribal affairs consultation, and public participation services.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3700 - Waste Reduction and Management 
The objectives of the Waste Reduction and Management Program include: 
• Overseeing that all nonhazardous solid waste is stored, collected, processed, and disposed in a safe and environmentally 
sound manner. 
• Participating in the development and maintenance of local solid waste management plans that describe how each city and 
county will reduce solid waste disposal to achieve at minimum a 50 percent diversion of waste from landfills. 
• Developing programs and policies to support the state goal that not less than 75 percent of solid waste generated be source 
reduced, recycled, or composted by the year 2020 and after. 
• Reducing organic waste disposal 75 percent by 2025 to support the state’s climate goals and rescue at least 20 percent of 
currently disposed surplus food by 2025. 
• Cleaning up solid waste disposal sites when the responsible party either cannot be identified or is unable or unwilling to pay 
for timely remediation, and where cleanup is needed to protect public health and safety, or the environment. 
• Developing and promoting waste reduction strategies through reuse, upcycling, and source reduction. 
• Promoting the use of recycled materials in California manufacturing. 
• Reducing the number of tires placed in landfills, illegally dumped, or stockpiled while promoting technologies turning waste

3715 - Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction 
CalRecycle administers the Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction program with a goal of achieving an 80-percent 
recycling rate for glass, aluminum, and plastic beverage containers sold in California. To achieve this goal, the Division of 
Recycling oversees the following: (1) that the California Redemption Value (CRV) is paid by beverage distributors for each 
beverage sold in California; (2) that consumers are refunded CRV for recycled beverage containers; (3) that recycling centers 
are conveniently located; (4) that grants are made to encourage recycling and development of markets for recycled materials; 
(5) that strong oversight and enforcement programs are in place to protect the integrity of the Beverage Container Recycling 
Fund; and (6) that public outreach and private partnerships are promoted.

3980   Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment 
The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances the health of Californians and the state's 
environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support, and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office 
performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as 
other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with scientific tools and information upon which to base risk-
management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing hazards and health risks, including risks to children and other 
sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, and fish and 
shellfish, as well as health and environmental impacts from climate change. The Office also evaluates community pollution 
burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities and reduce exposures and 
risks to residents.
