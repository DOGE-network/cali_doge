8955   Department of Veterans Affairs 
The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) honors and serves California's veterans and their families by ensuring 
our veterans have access to the benefits they have earned to enable them to meet their needs. CalVet promotes and delivers 
innovative services through efficient, cost-effective programs and collaboration with key stakeholders and partners. 
More specifically, CalVet: 
• Communicates with California's veterans and their families at all pivotal moments throughout their post-military lives to 
educate them and connect them to their federal, state, and local benefits. 
• Provides California veterans and their families with direct representation in presenting their claims and appeals for benefits 
before the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Board of Veteran Appeals. 
• Provides California veterans the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership through direct low-cost loans 
to acquire farms and homes. 
• Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with premier rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a 
home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes. 
This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public 
purposes; promote patriotism; recognize and reward sacrifice and service to our country; and provide needed readjustment 
assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to our country's call to 
military service. 
Because CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 
this need.  For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."
