PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
2050 - TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT 
 
The objectives of this program are to minimize deaths, injuries, and property losses due to traffic accidents; to reduce traffic
delays to the motoring public; to provide protection and assistance to the motoring public, state employees and property,
including protection of the State Capitol and the surrounding grounds, state constitutional officers, and visiting dignitaries;
and to curtail the potential for terrorist threats as part of broader state and federal homeland security efforts.  These
objectives are achieved through both ground and flight operations. 
 
2055 - REGULATION AND INSPECTION 
 
The CHP operates 55 commercial vehicle enforcement facilities statewide with the objectives of: 
Reducing the incidence of truck and bus accidents attributable to defective vehicle equipment, improper maintenance,
loading or securing of cargo, or disqualified drivers.
Protecting the public from spills of hazardous materials or specially regulated loads, and from the improper operation of
specified vehicles such as ambulances and armored cars.
Protecting farm workers transported in farm labor vehicles and children transported in school buses.
Ensuring that proper registration fees are paid, and protecting highways from excessive vehicle weights.
 
2060 - VEHICLE OWNERSHIP SECURITY 
 
This program protects the public from vehicle theft through: 
Investigation and prosecution of the professional vehicle thief.
Assistance and training of CHP and allied agency personnel.
Prevention of vehicle theft through public awareness and coordination with the insurance, trucking, construction, auto
manufacturing, and auto sale industries.
 
9900100 - ADMINISTRATION

DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS 
 
 
2740    Department of Motor Vehicles
 
The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) promotes driver safety by licensing drivers and protects consumers by issuing
vehicle titles and regulating vehicle sales. 
 
Since department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on DMV's Capital Outlay Program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Driver License and Identification Card Federal Compliance - Federal regulations require states to become fully compliant
with national standards for the issuance of state driver licenses and identification cards by October 1, 2020, after which
non-compliant cards will not be accepted for federal purposes such as boarding an airplane.  The Budget provides
$23 million to DMV to begin issuing federally compliant driver licenses and identification cards starting in January 2018. 
 
Motor Voter Program - Chapter 729, Statutes of 2015 (AB 1461), requires DMV to create an automatic voter registration
process for qualified individuals who apply for a driver license or identification card, or submit a change of address to
DMV.  The Budget provides $7 million to DMV to develop a fully automated and paperless process for applications for an
original driver license or identification card that meets the requirements of Chapter 729.
