PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6500 - STANDARDS 
The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also 
provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and 
counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices. 
The Standards Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures 
and program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement 
agencies. It also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a 
clearinghouse of successful program information. Finally, it conducts peace officer feasibility studies. 
6505 - TRAINING 
The Training Program increases the competency of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that meet 
identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses and assisting law enforcement 
agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission assesses 
training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met. The curricula cover a wide variety of topics 
necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training needs of 
law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly. The Training Program also presents advanced 
training for law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership 
Institute, and for trainers through the Instructor Development Institute. Other specialty programs include the Institute of Criminal 
Investigation. 
Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are 
enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards. 
6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING 
The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs associated 
with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses associated with 
training presentations to enable line officers to receive in-service training in areas of critical need. To encourage and assist local 
law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in the selection and training of law enforcement officers, 
the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties, approximately 346 cities, and numerous specialized districts 
and local agencies which have agreed to meet the Commission's standards. 
6515 - POST ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training is to be the leading organization in 
establishing professional standards, assuring top-quality training, and providing effective services to develop and support 
California law enforcement personnel. California POST consists of multiple bureaus to ensure uniform standards and 
compliance are applied to over 600 law enforcement agencies and 40 basic training academies statewide: Basic Training; 
Management Counseling and Projects; Strategic Communications and Research; Learning Technology Resources; Training 
Program Services; Training Delivery and Compliance; Computer Services; and Administrative Services. An additional six 
bureaus have been established to support implementation of the Peace Officer Standards Accountability Division. A final 
bureau, the Legal Affairs Bureau, which will be housed in the Executive Office.

8420   State Compensation Insurance Fund 
State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was originally 
enacted in 1913. State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing body of a 
private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of directors for 
approval. 
State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore 
injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers located 
in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on policies 
written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California, and the 
state is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the California civil 
service process and are actually employees of the state. 
State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the state and 
because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not 
financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund. 
Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation coverage 
and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to private 
employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers' 
compensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and 
other subdivisions of the State of California under a Master Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the state provides a 
deposit out of which State Fund pays compensation benefits to injured state workers and medical benefits to health providers, 
and State Fund is reimbursed by state agencies for benefit amounts paid plus a service fee equal to the cost of these services. 
For informational purposes only, the table further below provides summary data on actual and estimated workers' 
compensation claims costs paid by state agencies. All workers' compensation costs are included in the individual budgets of 
the responsible state agencies. Costs also include administrative charges under the Master Services Agreement.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6570 - AGRICULTURAL PLANT AND ANIMAL HEALTH; PEST PREVENTION; FOOD SAFETY SERVICES 
The objective of this program is to prevent the introduction and establishment of serious plant and animal pests and diseases to 
California, promote judicious antimicrobial use and stewardship and protect the safety of California's dairy, eggs and meat 
products that are exempt from federal inspection. In particular, the program is focused on pests and diseases that can: (1) be 
transmitted to humans, (2) inflict catastrophic financial loss on California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses, 
(3) have severe negative impacts on the environment, or (4) adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the 
consumer. 
6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES 
California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The 
objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural 
commodities, promote consumer protection, increase food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported 
grading services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the 
marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products. 
Additionally, this program provides support to governmental agencies that work to protect the nation's food supply and the 
environment by monitoring for chemical contaminants. 
6580 - ASSISTANCE TO FAIRS AND COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
This program provides fiscal and policy oversight to the network of California fairs. 
The State has a network of 79 fairs including county fairs, citrus fruit fairs, District Agricultural Associations and the California 
State Fair (an independent state agency). State oversight of these local fairs includes attendance of board meetings and 
periodic financial reviews and audits. 
6590 - GENERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
 
This program provides fiscal and policy oversight for federal grants that promote California agriculture, and for CDFA

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program activities that are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture. 
In addition, this program serves as the central point of contact for logistical coordination of all departmental resources, provides 
industry and agency coordination on environmental issues affecting agriculture, and provides centralized communications to 
California's agricultural industry, including County Agricultural Commissioners and the statewide fairgrounds. 
This program also partially reimburses County Agricultural Commissioners' Offices for carrying out agricultural programs 
authorized by the Food and Agricultural Code under the supervision of CDFA. 
9900 - EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES 
Executive and Management Services include the executive leadership of the Secretary's Office. The Secretary's Office sets 
priorities and policies to protect, support, and promote agriculture in the State of California, and helps to protect the health and 
welfare of the public and the environment. 
Administrative Services provides centralized administrative support to the Department through fiscal operations, employee-
employer relations, personnel management, employee development, and general business services.

candidates, and lobbyists, and assist with compliance. 
• Ensure that election campaign contribution and expenditure data is fully and accurately disclosed so that the voters may be 
fully informed. 
• Enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations fairly and with due process. 
• Regulate the activities of lobbyists and disclose their finances. 
• Provide for the disclosure of assets and income of public officials, which may affect their official actions, to avoid conflicts of 
interest or appearances of impropriety.

customers, 4 gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home park and propane operators. 
The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions 
include both backward-looking investigations and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk 
analytics to mitigate emerging threats and identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC performs operation and 
maintenance audits, outage inspections, mitigation reviews, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities and 
coordinates closely with state public safety agencies to further resilience initiatives. The PUC’s safety oversight includes 
enforcing public utility wildfire safety and Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) violations. It functions as the lead investigator 
for utility incidents relating to wildfire events and recommends policy to strengthen PSPS guidelines. In addition to the PUC 
opening formal investigations, the PUC imposes fines for natural gas, electric infrastructure, and wildfire safety-related 
violations. 
The PUC conducts reviews of utility operations every four years to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services. 
The PUC provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities—and to a lesser extent, as directed by statute, an increasing number 
of Community Choice Aggregators, Energy Service Providers, and Core Transport Agents—to follow when purchasing 
electricity and natural gas on behalf of their customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and 
where needed in the state.

Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation. The PUC is charged with 
implementing and overseeing key components of Chapter 547, Statutes of 2015 (SB 350); Chapter 312, Statutes of 2018 (SB 
100); and other climate change legislation, including promoting ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, Integrated 
Resource Planning, the state's mandated renewable energy programs, programs for disadvantaged communities, electric 
vehicle programs, and other clean energy programs. 
The PUC oversees programs and regulations to promote both natural gas and electricity reliability and resilience. 
The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate 
discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost 
weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria. 
The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for transmission, 
telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects. 
The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including 
monitoring competitive markets for proper operation, enforcing carrier service standards for telecommunication services, 
regulating rural telecommunication rates, protecting consumers against carrier abuses and fraud by applying licensing 
requirements and rules for offering and terminating telecommunication services, and managing efficient deployment of area 
codes and telephone numbers. 
The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to 
their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water and sewer service quality, 
promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and processing rate change requests, 
and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements. 
The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in 
participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in 
proceedings. 
The Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB) responds to questions regarding utility service and bills and assists consumers who have 
unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. CAB also provides data on the consumer protection 
issues it handles to stakeholders and decision makers to inform policy making. A Supplier Diversity program promotes and 
monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse. 
6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS 
The PUC oversees telecommunication-based universal service programs (Universal Lifeline Telephone Service Trust Fund, 
California Teleconnect Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, California Advanced Services Fund, and two 
California High Cost Funds), all of which provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these 
"universal service" programs include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) improving access 
to broadband technology to bridge the digital divide; and (3) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make 
informed choices about basic service and universal lifeline telephone services. 
The California LifeLine Program provides discounted basic residential wireless and wireline telephone service to qualified low-
income households. The California Teleconnect Fund Program provides discounted telecommunication services to qualifying 
schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program 
primarily provides equipment and telephone access services to people with hearing and other disabilities. The California 
Advanced Services Fund Program mainly encourages the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved and 
underserved rural and urban areas of California. The California High Cost Fund Programs provide subsidies to carriers 
obligated to provide telephone service to customers residing in rural and high-cost areas. 
6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION 
The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in 
California. All railroads, seven major rail transit agencies, six smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private 
crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-
certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and 
appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of 
hazardous materials by rail. 
For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train control, 
and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or 
disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, as well as crossing safety treatments deployed at each 
crossing. Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing 
hazard elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-
separating highway/rail crossings.

The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation 
companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, transportation network companies, and charter and scheduled bus operators) and 
privately-owned water ferries. The program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety 
standards and insurance requirements, and protects consumers from for-hire passenger carriers operating illegally. 
6695 - PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE 
The mandate and function of the Public Advocate's Office is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The Public 
Advocate's Office is charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility customers and subscribers in all 
significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction. 
Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the Public Advocate's Office with a director appointed by and serving at the 
pleasure of the Governor and charged the Public Advocate's Office with representing ratepayer interests in PUC proceedings. 
Chapter 1005, Statutes of 1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement 
Account to be transferred in the annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account. The law 
further required that "funds in the Public Utilities Commission Public Advocate's Office Account shall be utilized exclusively by 
the division in the performance of its duties as determined by the director" of the Public Advocates Office. 
Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that the Public Advocate's Office only represent ratepayers in 
PUC proceedings. SB 201 extended the Public Advocate's Office representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the 
Energy Commission, Air Resources Board, California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings.

8780   Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Governmental 
Organization and Economy 
The Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy (Commission) is the 
state's only independent and citizen-based oversight mechanism. It conducts four to five comprehensive reviews of executive 
branch programs, departments, and agencies each year and recommends ways to improve performance by increasing 
efficiency and effectiveness with existing resources. The Commission is statutorily responsible for analyzing and making 
recommendations to the Legislature on all Governor reorganization plans. 
The Commission is composed of two members of the Senate, two members of the Assembly, and nine unpaid citizen members 
- five appointed by the Governor and four appointed by the Legislature. 
Because of the Commission's independence, the Legislature charged it with oversight of the California State Auditor, including 
contracting with an independent auditor for annually examining the State Audit Fund.

local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants the State 
Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-created entity. 
The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute or requested by 
the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is responsible for annually 
conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the State's basic financial statements 
and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The Single Audit is federally required as a 
condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the Legislature enacted a program that 
requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial courts in 2012-13 and thereafter 
biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five judicial branch entities - which 
includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. 
The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, abuse, 
and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the authority 
to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk program, Chapter 
451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to identify local 
government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high risk for the 
potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their economy, efficiency, or 
effectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local entities. 
Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform 
independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. The 
State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of improper 
acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law. 
The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an 
application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10 
years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and 
conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6770 - STATE BUDGET 
To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance 
advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget. The Governor's Budget 
contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and proposed 
expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of Finance assists in 
the administration of the budget. The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state agencies and 
programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within existing resources, 
and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the Governor. Federal Funds 
Accountability and Cost Tracking functions support the coordination of the tracking, reporting, transparency, and accountability 
for federal stimulus and disaster recovery funds, while also performing certain federal disaster cost recovery activities in 
coordination with the California Office of Emergency Services. Basic and applied economic and tax research functions support 
the revenue estimates required for the development of the state financial plan, for the analysis of financial legislation, and the 
evaluation of economic trends or other fiscal developments which affect the state. Basic and applied demographic research 
functions provide data to support the workload estimates of state agencies. 
6775 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA (FI$Cal) PROJECT SUPPORT 
The Department of Finance is one of four partner agencies responsible for the development, implementation, utilization, and 
maintenance of an integrated statewide financial and administrative information technology system, FI$Cal. This program 
includes Department of Finance subject-matter experts assigned to the FI$Cal Project. 
6780 - STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS 
The Department of Finance systematically reviews and evaluates state-administered and financed programs. The Office of 
State Audits and Evaluations assists the Director of Finance in fulfilling the statutory responsibilities for supervision over all 
matters concerning the financial and business policies of the state by conducting financial audits and by performing critical 
examinations of state programs and policies including the oversight activities associated with the dissolution of redevelopment 
agencies. 
6785 - STATEWIDE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONSULTING AND TRAINING 
The Department of Finance is responsible for devising and maintaining a modern and uniform system of statewide accounting. 
The Fiscal Systems and Consulting Unit sets statewide fiscal and accounting policies and procedures.  The unit provides fiscal 
and accounting training, advice, and consulting services to departments to ensure that the state's assets are protected, and 
that accurate and timely financial information is maintained.  The Department of Finance participates in the development of 
statewide financial systems.

8880   Financial Information System for California 
The Department of FISCal operates the statewide financial system to enable California to perform budgeting, accounting, 
procurement and cash management functions transparently and efficiently. The Department of FISCal is responsible for 
supporting the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal), including supporting the system's customers and 
stakeholders. 
 
To ensure FI$Cal remains compliant with statewide fiscal and procurement policy, the four control agencies (the Department of 
Finance, the State Controller's Office, the State Treasurer's Office, and the Department of General Services) maintain a 
partnership with the Department of FISCal. FI$Cal provides the state with a single integrated financial management system that 
encompasses budgeting, accounting, procurement, cash management, and financial management and reporting. FI$Cal, 
through the adoption of best business practices, reengineers business processes; improves efficiency; enhances decision 
making and resource management; and provides reliable, accessible, and timely statewide financial information allowing the 
state to be more transparent. FI$Cal further enables transparency through its Open FI$Cal website, which was implemented in 
2018 pursuant to Government Code section 11862. The website continues to expand providing the public with access to a 
growing number of the state's non-confidential expenditures.

8940   Military Department 
The Military Department is responsible for the command, leadership and management of the California National Guard, Youth 
and Community Programs, State Guard and the Naval Militia. The California Military Department, under proper authority, 
organizes, resources, and trains forces with unique capabilities to serve the community, state, and nation. The purpose of the 
California National Guard is to provide mission ready forces to the federal government as directed by the President, emergency 
public safety support to civil authorities as directed by the Governor, and support to our member's families and to the 
community. With an authorized strength of approximately 19,000, the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are 
organized, manned, and funded in accordance with federal Departments of the Army and Air Force regulatory guidance. 
The Military Department Youth and Community Program serves California communities and families by delivering national 
level, high quality educational support programs, in partnership with the educational community, within a military, academic 
structured environment. 
Because the Military Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6911 - NATIONAL GUARD 
The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our 
State Guard. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, communications, law 
enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air defense, airlift and unmanned 
aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The Office of the Adjutant General 
element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such as personnel and fiscal resource 
management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information technology. The Military Civil Support 
element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so that mutual understanding and unity of 
purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, prepare, and train for the deployment of 
Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called to state service by the Governor due to 
domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and other public agencies with the coordination 
necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Guard is a volunteer component of the Military Department whose 
mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during training, preparation for mobilization, demobilization, and 
provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state emergencies. The federal government provides virtually all 
supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support services necessary for training, deployment, and commitment of 
the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance with the Department of the Army and Air Force Regulations and 
Training Guidance. 
6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS 
The Military Department manages and maintains partnerships with the following twelve programs while serving more than 
13,000 youth annually: California Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, Porterville Military 
Academy, Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy, California Job ChalleNGe, 
STARBASE Academy Sacramento, STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos, STARBASE Academy Porterville, and STARBASE 
Academy San Luis Obispo. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 by the California Legislature and then- Adjutant 
General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program that is designed to provide maximum growth and 
leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school levels. It provides leadership opportunities for cadets 
by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as leaders in their cadet military units, and by demonstrating 
proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their communities. As part of their training, cadets aid and support to the 
school and community. The Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, and Porterville Military Academy develops 
leaders of character by providing rigorous programs to promote excellence in academics, leadership, citizenship, athletics, and 
physical fitness/wellbeing. Additionally, the programs instill the 10 Cadet Corps values of loyalty, education, ambition, duty, 
enthusiasm, respect, service, health, integrity, and personal courage. Using a military framework, these programs graduate 
cadets who can meet the admissions requirements for college and who are prepared for their roles as future leaders. The 
mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is to intervene in and reclaim the lives of 15½-18 year old high school 
dropouts. Graduates leave the program with the values, life skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as 
productive citizens. California Job ChalleNGe located at Los Alamitos, CA is a continuation program to provide vocational skills 
to California ChalleNGe graduates. The overall mission provides post-secondary Career Technical Education (CTE) training to 
place graduates into viable jobs. The goal of the Department of Defense STARBASE program is to motivate elementary school 
students, primarily 5th graders, to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as they continue their 
education. The curriculum is designed to increase student involvement and interest in STEM, enhance their understanding of 
the role that STEM literacy plays in their lives, strengthen potential for future careers, and make the pursuit of STEM activities

8955   Department of Veterans Affairs 
The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) honors and serves California's veterans and their families by ensuring 
our veterans have access to the benefits they have earned to enable them to meet their needs. CalVet promotes and delivers 
innovative services through efficient, cost-effective programs and collaboration with key stakeholders and partners. 
More specifically, CalVet: 
• Communicates with California's veterans and their families at all pivotal moments throughout their post-military lives to 
educate them and connect them to their federal, state, and local benefits. 
• Provides California veterans and their families with direct representation in presenting their claims and appeals for benefits 
before the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Board of Veteran Appeals. 
• Provides California veterans the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership through direct low-cost loans 
to acquire farms and homes. 
• Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with premier rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a 
home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes. 
This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public 
purposes; promote patriotism; recognize and reward sacrifice and service to our country; and provide needed readjustment 
assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to our country's call to 
military service. 
Because CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 
this need.  For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

9100   Tax Relief 
This budget provides funding for cities and counties to help defray the loss of revenue as a result of the Homeowners' Property 
Tax Relief Program, a program that provides California homeowners assistance through a $7,000 exemption from property tax, 
and the Open Space Subventions Program, a program that provides tax relief to individuals who agreed to hold their land as 
open space under the Williamson Act of 1965.  This budget also receives loan repayments from people participating in the 
Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
7500 - HOMEOWNERS' PROPERTY TAX RELIEF 
In order to reduce California taxpayers' property tax burden, the California Constitution exempts homeowners from paying 
property taxes on the first $7,000 of the assessed value of their principal place of residence. The Constitution requires the state 
to reimburse local governments for revenues lost due to the homeowners' exemption. This Program also receives repayments 
from persons participating in the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Program, whereby the 
state makes property tax payments for qualified homeowners in exchange for the participants making repayment when they 
relinquish ownership. 
7505 - SUBVENTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE 
The Williamson Act permits cities and counties to enter into contracts with landowners to limit the use of land to agricultural, 
scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to be 
assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties to 
partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program.

9285   Trial Court Security - Court Construction 
This budget establishes a process and mechanism for counties to request funding if court construction projects, occupied on or 
after October 9, 2011, modify or create building features that increase overall trial court security costs. Trial Court Security was 
realigned from the state to counties through 2011 Public Safety Realignment. Proposition 30, passed by the voters in 2012, 
requires the state to provide annual funding for newly required activities that have an overall effect of increasing county costs in 
this realigned program.

9286   Trial Court Security - Judgeships 
This budget establishes a mechanism to provide trial court security funding to counties for newly authorized and 
reallocated judgeships. Trial Court Security was realigned from the state to counties through 2011 Public Safety Realignment. 
Proposition 30, passed by the voters in 2012, requires the state to provide annual funding for newly required activities that have 
an overall effect of increasing county costs in this realigned program.

1Totals reflect Build America Bond subsidy.
2General Obligation bond expenditures include repayment of debt service for various departments funded by a series of bonds; however, the state may assign 
each maturity of the bonds to one or more departments, rather than having all of the debt allocated to a department mature proportionally across the entire 
maturity schedule.  Regardless of the debt service allocated among departments, the aggregate debt service obligation of the state remains the same.
3Includes higher education debt service paid through the University of California and California State University main budget items.

9610   Lease-Revenue Notes and Bonds 
This budget is limited to those long-term lease arrangements, generally resulting in a capital acquisition or improvement, for 
which a bond has been issued as the underlying source of funds. This budget reflects expenditures for the appropriations 
necessary for the lease payments that are contained in the support budgets of the affected departments or agencies and may 
vary from this display because of reimbursements from bond surplus accounts. This display is intended to meet the needs of 
the financial community for summary information relating to lease-revenue debt.

9612   Enhanced Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed Bonds 
In accordance with Government Code section 63049.1, the Enhanced Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed Bonds item 
appropriates $1,000 and authorizes the Director of Finance to allocate up to $200 million General Fund if tobacco settlement 
revenues are insufficient to pay the costs of debt service and operating expenses. While this authority was necessary to sell the 
Tobacco Settlement Revenue backed bonds, it is not anticipated that the General Fund will be required to make any payments.

9620   Cash Management and Budgetary Loans 
The Cash Management and Budgetary Loans budget tracks General Fund expenditures for interest costs related to cash flow 
and budgetary borrowing. Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow imbalances 
during the fiscal year. Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the General Fund may 
need to borrow even though its budget is balanced. Budgetary loans may be used to loan monies from various state funds to 
the General Fund to help bridge a budget shortfall. These loans are temporary, and do not harm the operations of departmental 
programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
7720 - CASH MANAGEMENT 
Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities 
Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to as 
"borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted. Those provisions, in slightly 
modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables the 
General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent. The use of these funds' 
money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds. This mechanism does not interfere 
with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method. Generally, when a fund is 
designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State Controller's 
Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund cash 
shortage. For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund. The entire cash 
balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes. 
A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79, 
Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state entity 
that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA. The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500 million 
and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion. There are currently no deposits in this 
Program. 
A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033, Government 
Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity for 
the state's cash management. The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the maximum amount for the VIP 
from all local entities combined is $10 billion. No deposits have been made into this Program. 
Borrowing From Financial Markets 
In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this doctrine, 
an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section 1 of Article 
XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This doctrine was 
invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and again in 1971 to 
validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions were invoked in 
1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like registered warrants, 
required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes provisions were re-
enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84. 
In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided the 
flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external funds

results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which the 
General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. 
External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation warrants 
(RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs). RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in anticipation of 
receiving revenues in the near future. 
Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any 
other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow. 
Overall Program 
Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for the 
past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts nor 
disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. To reflect cash flow, budget data is 
converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the Controller and for 
accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and administrative actions. 
The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and 
assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used 
from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year. 
7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS 
The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are repaid over 
multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are repaid with interest calculated at the Pooled Money 
Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

9625   Interest Payments to the Federal Government 
Pursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), the state will incur an interest liability to the federal 
government. The purpose of CMIA is to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the exchange of funds between 
the federal government and the state. The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely fund 
disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds in the 
state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal government 
from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state account; and (d) the 
federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the state account until the 
funds are paid out for program purposes. 
The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $422 million or more in federal fund 
expenditures. For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e., 
check) issuance. State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be 
deposited before the warrants are issued. 
Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year. The payment will be for the interest 
liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

9650   Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants 
This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents. 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan. 
Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was added 
in 1982. 
The 2022-23 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and prior to December 31, 2016, 
maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested 
members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment 
in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90 
percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer 
contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract. 
The 2022-23 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and after January 1, 2017, 
maintains the average 80/80 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871.3 for fully vested 
members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment 
in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 80 
percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer 
contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract. 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2022 monthly contribution 
maximums are $816 for a single enrollee, $1,548 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,983 for an enrollee and two or 
more dependents. The 2023 monthly contribution maximums are $883 for a single enrollee, $1,699 for an enrollee and one 
dependent, and $2,124 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan and number of 
dependents. 
Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code 
6645 under Higher Education. This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.

9658   Budget Stabilization Account 
Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization 
Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. Proposition 2 strengthened 
the reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the 
BSA, and increasing the reserve limit. 
Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers 
between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years. In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a calculated 
amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities. 
LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 
PROGRAM AUTHORITY 
Section 20 and Section 22, Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California. 
Control Section 35.50, Budget Act. 
Item 9658-011-0001, 2016 Budget Act and 2018 Budget Act. 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy day" 
50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital gains over 8 
percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50 percent to pay 
down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy day," reduced by 
any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates to pay down debt. The maximum balance in the BSA is limited to 
10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes for the fiscal year. Any amounts in excess of ten percent may only be used for 
infrastructure needs. 
Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years. 
The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds 
from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for 
appropriation in the immediately preceding fiscal year. 
Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years. This will 
smooth school spending and minimize future cuts. The Proposition 98 reserve does not change the Proposition 98 minimum 
guarantee calculation.  See 9889 - Public School System Stabilization Account for more information on the Proposition 98 
reserve.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
7765 - EQUITY CLAIMS 
This program includes all claims approved by the three-member California Victim Compensation Board and the Government 
Claims Program under the Department of General Services, and referred to the Legislature in the omnibus claims bills for 
payment. The program provides an equitable procedure for the payment of the following categories of claims: 
• Claims for which no appropriation has been made or for which no fund is available, but the settlement of which has been 
provided for by statute or constitutional provision. 
• Claims for which the appropriation made or fund designated is exhausted. 
• Claims for which settlement is not otherwise provided for by statute or constitutional provision. 
The Government Claims Program was transferred to the Department of General Services from the former California Victim 
Compensation and Government Claims Board in July 2016. The California Victim Compensation and Government Claims 
Board became the California Victim Compensation Board. 
7770 - SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS 
This program includes claims paid through judgment and settlement bills sponsored by the Department of Justice each year. 
The claims are either judgments against the state or settlements approved by the Department of Justice pursuant to the 
authority provided in Government Code Section 948 et seq.

9800   Augmentation for Employee Compensation 
This item reflects funding augmentations for state employee compensation. If the Legislature previously appropriated money, 
through this budget item, to pay for the economic terms of employee compensation in previous fiscal years, the funding for 
those economic terms is included in departments' budgets. When economic terms require funding not yet appropriated by the 
Legislature, those funds are included in this budget item. 
Additionally, this item sets aside funding for penalties the state may face under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Beginning in 
2015, the state became subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility provision of the ACA. This provision requires large 
employers to offer health benefits to full-time employees, defined as those who work on average 130 or more hours per month 
(or 30 hours per week), and their dependent children. Under this provision, the state may be subject to penalties (Part B 
Penalty), which may include part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees that may have been considered full-time for one or 
more months, were not offered or did not qualify for health benefits through the state, purchased health coverage from the 
Health Insurance Marketplace (known as Covered California), and received a premium tax credit or cost sharing reduction. 
The ACA also contains reporting requirements, which require the state to track specified ACA-related employee information on 
a monthly basis to identify the employees who meet health eligibility requirements, document whether benefits were offered,

and whether the employee accepted benefits. This data collection is used to report the state's level of ACA compliance to the 
Internal Revenue Service on an annual basis. The state may be assessed penalties for inaccurate reporting (Internal Revenue 
Code sections 6721 and 6722).

9840   Augmentation for Contingencies or Emergencies 
Each year, the Budget Act includes appropriation items in business unit 9840 to be used to supplement department's 
appropriations that are insufficient due to unanticipated expenditures or emergency situations. There are three separate 
appropriations, one for each fund type - General, special, and non-governmental cost funds. These appropriations are allocated 
to other departments by the Department of Finance based upon the determination of need.

9885   Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances 
For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not yet 
been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure totals. 
This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department budgets. 
For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that 
encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services. Furthermore, 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General 
Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and state 
policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide adjustment 
to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government Code Section 
13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary Schedule 1 for the 
General Fund. 
COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT 
The State Controller's Office accumulated a General Fund encumbrance total of $5,272,100,000 from 2020-21 year-end 
financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are estimated to be at the same 
level for the following fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within the next fiscal year.  Upon completion of the 
year-end financial reports by the State Controller's Office, the budget information will be updated in the spring.  The 
Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the encumbrance adjustment.

9889   Public School System Stabilization Account 
Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, established the Public School System Stabilization Account (PSSSA) as 
a ”rainy day“ reserve for K-14 schools. 
Proposition 2 requires Proposition 98 General Fund deposits into or withdrawals from the fund each year, as well as two 
preceding fiscal years, when specific criteria are met.  Calculation of a deposit or withdrawal from the PSSSA does not change 
the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee calculation.

9900   Statewide General Administrative Expenditures (Pro Rata) 
Central service agencies, such as Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, the State Controller, and Legislature, provide 
budgeting, banking, accounting, auditing, payroll, and other services to all state departments. The Pro Rata process apportions 
the costs of providing central administrative services to all state departments and funding sources that benefit from the 
services. Amounts apportioned to special funds for their fair share of central administrative services costs are transferred from 
the special funds to the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund. 
Prior to 2016-17, Pro Rata assessments to special funds were normally included in the appropriate departmental budgets. This 
budget item included Pro Rata transfers directly assessed to special funds for those cases where appropriate funding was not 
provided for in departmental budgets. Effective 2016-17, this budget item includes Pro Rata transfers assessed directly at the 
fund level, rather than each individual appropriation, pursuant to Government Code section 11274.
