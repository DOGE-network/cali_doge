PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3835 - HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE 
The Health Care Workforce Program, through the Health Care Workforce Development Division and the Health Professions 
Education Foundation, improves access to medical, mental, and dental health care providers in underserved areas throughout 
California. The Program conducts research to identify areas of unmet need and administers grants that provide financial 
incentives to individuals and institutions to increase the number of providers in those areas. The Program promotes health care 
workforce diversity and cultural competency. It includes the following programs: 
• Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Program 
• Mental Health Services Act Workforce Education and Training Program 
• California State Loan Repayment Program 
• Health Care Workforce Clearinghouse Program 
• Health Professions Career Opportunity Training Program 
• Health Workforce Pilot Projects Program 
• Shortage Designation Program 
• Health Professions Education Foundation Programs 
3840 - FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT 
The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and 
construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of 
providing sustained services to the public. 
3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE 
The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and 
nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors 
the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating 
access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California. 
3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 
The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from 
approximately 6,000 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and treatment 
data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory 
surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers, 
health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media. To further this 
mission, the Health Care Information Program is implementing new health care cost transparency data programs to collect and

4170   Department of Aging 
The Department of Aging's mission is to promote the independence and well-being of older adults, adults with disabilities, and 
families through: 
• Access to information and services to improve the quality of their lives, 
• Opportunities for community involvement, 
• Support to family members providing care, and 
• Collaboration with other state and local agencies. 
As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the Department administers federal Older Americans Act programs that 
provide a wide variety of community-based supportive services and administers the Health Insurance Counseling and 
Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that operate 
the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies Community-
Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid. 
The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the 
local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults 
with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3890 - NUTRITION 
The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally-balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60 
years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the 
isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and 
assistance, employment, and education. 
3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 
The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized 
training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also 
promotes transition to unsubsidized employment. 
3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 
This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers, 
grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance, 
legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term 
Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support 
necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care 
services appropriate to their needs. 
3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 
This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides 
personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local 
source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans. 
3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services 
(CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age or over who 
are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or disabilities. The 
Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-
based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term 
care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility.

California Code of Regulations, Titles 9, 17 and 22. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• COVID-19 Estimate Impacts—The Budget includes costs of $8.1 billion total funds and savings of $155.1 million General 
Fund for COVID-19 impacts on the Medi-Cal program. Costs are primarily attributable to a significant increase in caseload 
associated with projected unemployment and the Medi-Cal response to COVID-19, offset by an assumed increase in the 
Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). Specifically, the Budget assumes that caseload will peak at 14.5 million in 
July 2020, or about 2.0 million above what caseload would have been absent the COVID-19 pandemic.  
• Suspensions—In addition to suspensions included in the 2019 Budget Act, the Budget suspends all Proposition 56 programs 
other than women’s health, family planning, and the Loan Repayment Program on July 1, 2021. The suspension will be lifted 
if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to 
support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal years. 
• Nursing Facility Financing—The Budget includes $185.6 million ($92.8 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to extend through 
December 1, 2022 the financing system for skilled nursing facilities, originally established pursuant to Chapter 875, Statutes 
of 2004 (AB 1629). In addition, the Budget includes a 10-percent rate increase for SNFs assumed to be in effect for four 
months during the COVID-19 emergency, at a General Fund cost of $72.4 million in 2019-20 and $41.6 million in 2020-21. 
• 340B Supplemental Payment Pool—The Budget includes $52.5 million ($26.3 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to provide 
supplemental payments to specified non-hospital clinics who participated in the federal 340B pharmacy program. These 
payments grow to $105 million ($52.5 million General Fund) in 2021-22 and annually thereafter. 
• Managed Care Efficiencies—The Budget implements changes to the way that managed care capitation rates are 
determined. These changes include various acuity, efficiency, and cost containment adjustments. These adjustments would 
be effective for the managed care rate year starting January 1, 2021, and would yield savings of $193.6 million ($63 million 
General Fund) in 2020-21. Additionally, the Budget assumes a 1.5 percent rate reduction for the July 1, 2019, through 
December 31, 2020, period, resulting in savings of $586 million ($182 million General Fund) in 2020-21. The Budget does 
not implement a maximum fee schedule for inpatient services in the managed care program. 
• Hearing Aids Grant Program—The Budget includes $352,000 General Fund in 2020-21 to administer and establish a 
program to assist with the cost of hearing aids and related services for children without health insurance coverage in 
households with incomes up to 600 percent of the federal poverty level, no sooner than July 1, 2021. The Budget assumes 
ongoing costs of approximately $15 million General Fund to provide and administer this benefit.    
• Managed Care Organization Tax—The Budget includes $1.7 billion in General Fund savings associated with the federal 
government’s approval of a three-year managed care organization (MCO) provider tax. The MCO tax is estimated to result in 
approximately $4.9 billion in General Fund savings over the full three years of the tax.

4265   Department of Public Health 
The California Department of Public Health (Public Health) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all 
Californians through the following core activities: 
• Protecting the public from communicable diseases. 
• Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments, and improving social determinants of health and healthy 
communities. 
• Preventing disease, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities by embedding health and 
mental health equity language, tools, and approaches into all public health and partner agency policies, programs, systems, 
and resource allocation. 
• Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. 
• Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status; inform people, institutions and communities; and to 
guide public health strategies, programs, and actions. 
• Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces. 
• Providing access to quality, population-based health services. 
Because Public Health's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

4300   Department of Developmental Services 
The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for 
providing persons with developmental disabilities the services and supports they need to lead more independent and 
productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy and provides 
leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities, standards, and procedures within which the 
developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems 
that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community agencies 
known as regional centers as well as through a developmental center and a state-operated community facility. The Department, 
through the 21 regional centers, oversees coordination of services to persons with developmental disabilities; provides that 
such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each stage of their lives; and, to 
the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community. 
Because the Department of Developmental Services' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has 
a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Supplemental Rate Increases for Additional Service Codes—The Budget includes $18 million ($10.8 million General Fund) in 
2020-21 and 2021-22 to provide supplemental rate increases for Early Start Specialized Therapeutic Services, Infant 
Development and Independent Living Services. This approach is consistent with the supplemental rate increases included in 
the 2019 Budget Act. The increased funding for the three services will be suspended on December 31, 2021. The 
suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General 
Fund revenue to support all suspended programs. 
• Uniform Holiday Schedule—The Budget includes $51.5 million ($31.3 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to suspend 
implementation of the Uniform Holiday Schedule. The funding will be suspended on December 31, 2021. The suspension will 
be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue 
to support all suspended programs. 
• COVID-19 Impacts—The Budget includes $336.7 million ($237.5 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to reflect impacts of 
COVID-19 on the developmental services system. These changes reflect increased costs associated with increased 
utilization in purchase of services specific to residential settings, respite, and personal attendants. These costs also reflect 
surge development at the developmental centers and in the community. 
• Incompetent to Stand Trial (IST) Capacity—The Budget includes $16.4 million General Fund in 2020-21 to activate a 20-bed 
unit at Porterville Developmental Center (PDC) and develop five enhanced behavioral support homes to increase capacity 
for IST placements and secure community resources for individuals at PDC. The increased funding for the 20-bed unit PDC 
will sunset on June 30, 2023. 
• Fairview Developmental Center Warm-Shutdown—The Budget includes $11.9 million General Fund to extend the warm-
shutdown period at Fairview Developmental Center through 2020-21 until a site assessment is completed to inform the 
disposition of the property.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4140 - COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM 
Through the network of regional centers, the Department supports the development and maintenance of services for eligible 
persons with developmental disabilities who reside in the community. The regional centers directly provide or coordinate the 
following services and supports: (1) information and referral, (2) assessment and diagnosis, (3) counseling, (4) lifelong 
individualized planning and service coordination, (5) purchase of necessary services included in the individual program plan, 
(6) assistance in finding and using community and other resources, (7) advocacy for the protection of legal, civil, and service 
rights, (8) early intervention services for infants and their families, (9) family support, (10) planning, placement, and monitoring 
for 24-hour out-of-home care, (11) training and educational opportunities for individuals and families, (12) community education 
about developmental disabilities, and (13) habilitation services. 
4145 - STATE-OPERATED RESIDENTIAL AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES PROGRAM 
The Department currently operates two residential facilities: Fairview Developmental Center (Orange County) and Porterville 
Developmental Center (Tulare County). Secure treatment services are provided at the Porterville Developmental Center

for individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial due to their developmental disability. The Department is 
projected to operate seven Stabilization, Training, Assistance, and Reintegration (STAR) residences by the fall of 2020 in 
Northern, Central, and Southern California to provide acute crisis services in the community.  The Department also leases one 
small community facility for persons who require specialized behavioral interventions: Canyon Springs, a 63-bed facility in 
Cathedral City (Riverside County). 
All residential facilities are licensed as General Acute Care Hospitals with distinct parts for skilled nursing care and intermediate 
care. Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility, and STAR residences operate as community crisis homes. 
Services at all facilities involve the provision of active treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis, 
including appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, and assistance with activities of daily living, 
training, education, and employment. 
Individuals served in the STAR crisis residences are committed by a court order to the Department for suitable treatment and 
habilitation services during a crisis, and are provided services and supports necessary to prepare them for return to their 
residential home or to transition to a new living option. The primary objective of this program is to provide a safety net of 
services that include providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents based upon assessed 
need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most efficient, effective, and 
least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system; and are designed to teach 
individuals the skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and welfare, and enhance 
personal competence in all areas of daily living. 
Fairview Developmental Center and the non-secure treatment portion of Porterville Developmental Center transitioned the last 
resident into a community setting in December 2019. 
4149 - PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of this program is to: (1) provide overall management, planning and policy development, legal, legislative, audit, 
and administrative services; (2) manage revenue and reimbursement collections from federal and state programs, insurance 
companies, and private payers for the cost of services; (3) monitor regional center operations for compliance with statute, 
regulations, and their contract with the Department; (4) provide central administrative and clinical management services to 
the two residential facilities and the leased small community facility to oversee the quality of services provided, compliance with 
state licensing and federal certification requirements, protection of consumers and staff, and maintenance of facility structures 
and grounds; and (5) oversee areas that include the development of policy and procedures for developmental center 
operations, law enforcement and protective services, facility population management, program and fiscal oversight, and facility 
planning and support.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facilities under its control, 
including two state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities 
are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County and Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County. 
The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 2.3 million gross square feet in 319 buildings on 784 acres.  As of 
December 2019, the Fairview Developmental Center and the Porterville General Treatment Area transitioned all former 
residents to community living.  The Department will continue to maintain the Fairview property in warm shutdown mode until 
disposition of the property.  The Department also operates two residences and is developing five more for Stabilization, 
Training, Assistance, and Reintegration programs that provide acute crisis services in the community.  Additionally, the 
Department is responsible for the maintenance of interior finishes and equipment at a 57,000 square foot leased facility in 
Riverside County.  These facilities are used to aid the Department's mission in providing medical, dental, and nursing care; 
active treatment; supervision; education; and vocational training for residents with developmental disabilities.

full service law enforcement agency that protects the safety and security of the state hospital facilities, staff and patients. DSH 
provides training standards, model programs, cultural competency, program development, and a comprehensive training plan 
to all protective services staff. The HPO Academy requires that cadets successfully complete 548 hours of multidisciplinary 
training specific to the DSH police officer job specifications. 
4420 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM 
The Conditional Release Program is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic patients. 
Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began operations on 
January 1, 1986. 
4420010 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM 
The Conditional Release Program General/Non-Sexually Violent Predators is comprised of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity, 
Mentally Disordered Offender, felony Incompetent to Stand Trial, and Mentally Disordered Sex Offender patients. Individuals 
suitable for this program may be recommended by the state hospital medical director to the courts for outpatient treatment. 
Currently, DSH contracts with seven county-operated and three private organizations serving all 58 counties in the state with 
non-SVP commitments. 
4420020 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM - SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS 
The Conditional Release Program-Sexually Violent Predators was added to the Conditional Release Program effective January 
1, 1996 per Welfare and Institutions Code 6604. Prior to the conditional release of the first sexual violent predator in 
2003, conditional release providers did not have treatment services that would allow them to accept sexually violent predators 
as patients, requiring the Department of State Hospitals to enter into an annual contract with a single private provider serving 
58 counties. Current statue requires the sexually violent predators be conditionally released to their county of domicile and 
sufficient funding be available to provide treatment and supervision services when a sexually violent predator is conditionally 
released into the community by court order. 
4430 - CONTRACTED PATIENT SERVICES 
The Department of State Hospitals contracts with local entities to provide mental health services to some of its patients outside 
of state hospital facilities. This includes both the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County as well as 
various other jail-based competency treatment programs.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
4430010 - ADMISSION, EVALUATION, STABILIZATION CENTER 
The Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County Jail receives incompetent to stand trial patients 
committed to the Department of State Hospitals directly from catchment counties in southern California. Patients receive a full 
evaluation upon admission to determine whether they can be treated through the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization 
Center on a short-term basis or may need longer-term state hospital treatment. Patients considered to be short-term can be 
treated and discharged directly from the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center. 
4430020 - JAIL-BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT 
The Jail-Based Competency Treatment Program focuses on defendants deemed incompetent to stand trial and provides 
mental health treatment to defendants in county jails, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in court 
proceedings. 
4440 - EVALUATION AND FORENSIC SERVICES 
Evaluation and Forensic Services is comprised of the Mentally Disordered Offender and the Sex Offender Commitment 
Programs. Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of 
Parole Hearings to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs 
evaluations to determine if individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the Mentally Disordered Offender program. These 
evaluations are used by the Board of Parole Hearings in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of 
State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995) 
was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to 
be sexually violent predators. The Sex Offender Commitment Program administers clinical screenings and performs 
evaluations to determine if prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for a sexually violent predator commitment to the 
Department of State Hospitals upon completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the ultimate determination whether 
an individual is likely to be a sexually violent predator and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the Department of 
State Hospitals.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS 
The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through 
financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services. 
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households 
to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related 
emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard 
the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which 
supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used 
along with LIHEAP weatherization related services. 
The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-
income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides weatherization and renewable energy services in low-income 
single-family and multi-family dwellings within disadvantaged communities to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LIWP 
includes projects such as weatherization and solar water heater and solar photovoltaic systems installations. 
4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES 
The Community Services Block Grant is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community organizations to 
help low-income families achieve and maintain self-sufficiency through a broad range of activities. These activities include 
education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional 
services. Additionally, Community Services Block Grant funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-
income communities. 
The California Earned Income Tax Credit (Cal EITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax 
credits to boost the income of eligible families. Since 2017-18 CSD has worked with the Franchise Tax Board and non-profit 
and community-based organizations to increase awareness of the Cal EITC and provide free tax preparation assistance to 
Californians.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES 
The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities through 
vocational rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that persons with disabilities 
may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In addition, the 
Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education, mental 
health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process, 
which gives priority to persons with the most significant disabilities. 
Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range of 
services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, supported 
employment and independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their 
communities. The Department provides career counseling and information and referral services to encourage individuals 
working in non-competitive, non-integrated settings to work toward and achieve competitive integrated employment. 
The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition student services, known as DOR Student Services, and 
auxiliary aids and services necessary to participate in such services to a wide range of students with disabilities, ages 16 
through 21 (or upon matriculation from high school, whichever is later), including many who may benefit from early career 
development. DOR Student Services include job exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary 
education counseling, workplace readiness training, and instruction in self-advocacy.  
The Department provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to enable persons who are blind or visually 
impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias. Prevocational, including 
employment readiness, services are provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to consumers with vision loss to prepare 
them for vocational rehabilitation services and independent living. 
The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation 
services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and 
establishes fees for services provided to its consumers. 
The Department works with the federal government to administer the California Career Innovations Demonstration Project to 
identify how to increase the self-sufficiency of students with disabilities by providing work-based learning experiences and 
planned education to prepare them for workplace success. 
4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES 
The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout 
California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently with full 
inclusion in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems 
change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion 
services to community based living, and transition services to postsecondary life for youth. 
The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their 
families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons with 
TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for 
family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to 
administer a TBI partnership grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a 
statewide TBI registry, needs assessment, and resource plan. 
The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 17 non-profit community-based 
organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually 
impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low 
vision training, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, independent living 
skills development, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services 
to departmental programs.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
Disregard Payments to Families—The Budget increases the amount of child support payments passed through to CalWORKS 
families, effective January 1, 2022, from the current $50 to $100 for a family with one child and $200 for a family with two or 
more children. This change is anticipated to result in an additional $34 million annually passed-through to approximately 
160,000 CalWORKs families. The Budget includes $800,000 ($300,000 General Fund) in 2020-21 for the necessary 
automation changes needed to implement the proposal in 2021-22. 
The Budget includes an ongoing $46.4 million General Fund reduction for child support administration, that will be 
restored, should federal funds become available by October 15, 2020. This reduction includes: 
• Savings of $38.1 million to revert Local Child Support Agency Funding to 2018 levels. 
• Savings of $8.3 million to reduce state operations and contracts cost.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM 
The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing 
parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and 
enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-
D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families block grant. 
4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION: 
The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating 
expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The 
federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs. 
4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION: 
Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal 
certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State 
Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts 
and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support 
Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments 
from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program 
provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS 
The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support 
themselves. These programs are comprised of five components: 
• California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) 
• Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food 
Assistance Programs 
• Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program 
• County Administration and Automation Projects 
• Disaster Relief 
The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to 
enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor, 
administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services. 
4270010 - CalWORKs: 
The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is 
California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic 
needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes 
specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet 
these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs 
recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Stage One is administered by the 
Department of Social Services. Stages Two and Three are administered by the California Department of Education. Parents 
have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs 
families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and 
development services. 
4270019 - Other Assistance Payments: 
The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term 
residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as 
a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is 
administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social 
Services as authorized by federal and state law. The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to 
relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system. 
The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate 
the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in 
accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and 
state law. 
California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs: 
• The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States 
provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs. 
• The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and 
independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States 
unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the 
minor. 
• The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human 
trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are 
available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under 
CalWORKs). 
The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of 
nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of 
purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations 
eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits 
due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program.

2020-21 STATE BUDGET — HHS 179
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in 
employment and training activities. 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution 
to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for 
household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with 
food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a 
state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses. 
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious 
supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity 
Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services 
on October 1, 2016. 
4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program: 
The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled 
persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a 
State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who 
determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients. 
4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects: 
Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who 
administer public assistance programs. 
Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services. 
4270046 - Disaster Relief: 
The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have 
suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance 
programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select 
recovery grants. 
4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING 
The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child 
welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and 
procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of 
the service delivery system. 
4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services: 
The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in 
their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who 
either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs 
that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option, 
and IHSS-Residual Program. 
4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing: 
The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse 
Prevention. 
Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and 
prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated 
services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with 
the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and 
least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from 
foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff. 
In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter 
773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to change 
out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment and case 
planning. 
The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and

private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for 
children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services 
include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents; 
training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For 
independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the 
biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice. 
The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and 
sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and 
services for at risk families and their children. 
The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of abuse, neglect, or financial 
exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary. 
The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health 
and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes 
facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components. 
4275028 - Special Programs: 
The Special Programs provides funds for Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance, Access Assistance to the 
Deaf, Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services and Legal Services for Unaccompanied and 
Undocumented Minors. 
4280 - TITLE IV-E WAIVER 
The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California. This project provides 
participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state foster care 
maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable. 
4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES 
The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and 
provide administrative services to other agencies. 
4285010 - Disability Evaluation: 
The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents 
applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of 
the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and 
overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. 
4285019 - Services to Other Agencies: 
In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative 
services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human 
Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public 
information services. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and 
administrative support services to other departmental programs.

5195   State-Local Realignment, 1991 
In the 1991-92 fiscal year, State-Local Program Realignment restructured the state-county partnership by giving counties 
increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment 
provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $750 million General Fund in 2020-21 to provide support for counties experiencing revenue losses for 
realigned programs. In utilizing these funds, counties will prioritize support for health and human services, entitlement 
programs, and programs that serve vulnerable populations. This funding is not reflected in this document. To the extent the 
federal government provides sufficient eligible funding by October 15, 2020, an additional $250 million may be provided to 
counties for the aforementioned purposes.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT 
The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve 
improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability 
for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage 
cost-effective approaches to providing services. 
Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts 
are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified 
in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to 
ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision 
ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for 
county health and social services programs.

Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a 
dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility. 
Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services,

and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is 
appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and 
technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at 
less cost. 
The funding sources for realignment are: 
• The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax. 
• The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts: 
• Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services) 
• Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care; 
Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment) 
• Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs) 
• Trial Court Security Subaccount 
• Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and 
Adult Parole) 
• Community Corrections Subaccount 
• District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount 
• Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant 
Special Account) 
The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on 
statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures. 
Note the $4.4 billion in 2019-20 and $4.5 billion in 2020-21 shown below reflect the Health and Human Services public safety 
programs. This display does not reflect the funding for the non-Health and Human Services public safety programs. For the full
