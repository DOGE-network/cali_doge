Environmental
Protection
California Environmental Protection Agency
programs reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
restore and protect environmental quality, and
protect public health. The Secretary coordinates
the state's environmental regulatory programs
and ensures fair and consistent enforcement of
environmental law, which safeguards the state's
residents and promotes the state's economic
vitality.
 
3900    Air Resources Board
 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These
plans include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board
and local air pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the
Secretary for Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020
and at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249,
Statutes of 2016 (SB 32). 
 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE 
 
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as
follows: 
Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations limiting criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and toxic air
contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assess the effectiveness of established
procedures.
Develop testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuel additives, and test
equipment to ensure emission standards are met.
 
3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE 
 
The Stationary Source Program works with air pollution control districts and business and scientific communities to reduce
emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as follows: 
Develop, implement, and enforce measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by the
California Clean Air Act and work with local air pollution control districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient
air quality standards.
Identify substances that are toxic air contaminants and develop, implement, and enforce measures to control toxic air
contaminant emissions from stationary sources.
 
3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 40 percent
below 1990 levels by 2030, as follows: 
Develop, implement, and enforce measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from mobile and
stationary sources, in accordance with AB 32 and SB 32.
Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission
reductions and other requirements of AB 32 and SB 32.
Develop, implement, and oversee programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, and
other incentive programs.
 
3515 - SUBVENTION 
 
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air pollution control districts to encourage and support effective
district programs. The state's 35 local air pollution control districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary
sources of air pollution in California. 
 
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM 
 
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Air Resources Board has 61 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 60 sites are leased. Of these
leased sites, 43 support air-monitoring stations and 17 sites support an array of vehicle testing, research, planning,
enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs; one of the support sites is also equipped with
an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air Resources Board oversees to support its
statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct
research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air Resources Board leadership role related to
greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND BROWNFIELDS REUSE 
 
The Site Mitigation and Brownfields Reuse program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal
Superfund program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,170 hazardous substance release site investigations
and cleanups, and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than  470 sites where the cleanup
process is complete.  Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately  820
land-use restrictions in place on properties throughout the state. 
 
New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other
previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to
return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund
properties, abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and
closed military installations. 
 
The program oversees environmental assessments and the clean-up of proposed new or expanding school sites to prevent
or reduce exposing students and staff to hazardous substances. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow
Hazardous Waste Site, a former hazardous waste disposal site and federal Superfund Site. 
 
The program works closely with other state agencies, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and local
agencies throughout the state to establish and implement viable grant and loan programs to aid in the assessment and
clean-up of brownfields sites. 
 
The program works with the California Emergency Management Agency and other state agencies to assure response
readiness for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway
hazardous waste spills and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories. 
 
3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT 
 
The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of
hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance
at 119 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous
waste, and approximately 300 facilities/generators that are subject to corrective actions.  Additionally, the program manages
approximately $2.2 billion in financial assurance resources, and supports and oversees local agencies implementing the
hazardous waste elements of the Unified Program. 
 
The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including
electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous
waste requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other
focused enforcement initiatives.  The program also ensures compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to
electronic waste and used oil.

3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS 
 
The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program strives to get manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to
toxic chemicals. SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products and use pollution prevention best practices. The
program implements the SCP regulations. SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in
order to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers
for the analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives.  The program encourages
the adoption of "green chemistry" practices. 
 
Pollution Prevention responsibilities are to promote compliance with legislative mandates regarding consumer product
chemical safety.  The program supports adoption of focused business sector pollution prevention strategies; supports local
green business initiatives; and helps the regulated community comply with laws and regulations.  
 
This program, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment, also implements the California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program. DTSC's Environmental
Chemistry Laboratory (ECL) is charged with measuring both targeted and new chemicals in blood and urine. Ongoing
activities include measuring these chemicals in studies of vulnerable populations, including mothers and their newborns,
older women, firefighters, and families with childhood leukemia. Additionally, ECL is continuously developing new methods
to identify and measure chemicals of emerging concern, including newer flame retardants and other substitutes and
alternatives for restricted/banned toxic chemicals. The SCP program will rely on biomonitoring results for implementation of
its three-year Priority Products Work Plan. Biomonitoring evidence has been called out in the Work Plan as a priority
screening tool for identification of product-chemical combinations warranting consideration of safer alternatives. 
 
3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY 
 
The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department of Toxic Substances Control as the Certified
Unified Program Agency (CUPA) in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the Department is responsible for
implementing the six elements of the Unified Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-
prevention control and countermeasure plans for owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; underground storage
tank program; hazardous material release response plans and inventories; California Accidental Release Prevention
program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories. 
 
3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEAN UP PROGRAM  
 
The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Clean Up Program oversees the removal and remedial actions in the
communities surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the
program, DTSC will test the soil for lead contamination in approximately 10,000 properties, including residences, schools,
daycare centers, and parks within a 1.7 mile radius of the facility.  The program will clean up contaminated soil at those
properties with the highest levels and greatest potential for exposure. 
 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
 
The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce
management, data processing, performance management, business services, and other administrative support to
departmental programs. Administration also supports operations in Sacramento, Clovis, Berkeley, Chatsworth, Cypress, San
Diego, and El Centro, including two environmental chemistry laboratories located in northern and southern California.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
3700 - Waste Reduction and Management 
 
The objectives of the Waste Reduction and Management Program include: 
Ensuring all nonhazardous solid waste is stored, collected, processed, and disposed in a safe and environmentally sound
manner.
Participating in development and maintenance of local solid waste management plans describing how each city and
county will reduce solid waste disposed to achieve at minimum a 50 percent diversion of waste from landfills.
Developing programs and policies to support the goal that not less than 75 percent of solid waste generated be source
reduced, recycled, or composted by the year 2020 .
Reducing the disposal of organic material through recycling and compositing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Cleaning up solid waste disposal sites when the responsible party either cannot be identified or is unable or unwilling to
pay for timely remediation, and where cleanup is needed to protect public health and safety, or the environment.
Developing and promoting waste reduction strategies through reuse, upcycling, and source reduction.
Promoting the use of recycled materials in California manufacturing.
Reducing the number of tires placed in landfills, illegally dumped, or stockpiled while promoting technologies turning
waste tires into useful products.
Reducing the amount of improperly disposed used oil and promoting used oil recycling.
Reducing electronic waste by providing safe and convenient collection and recycling of specified electronic equipment.
 
3710 - Education and the Environment Initiative 
 
In cooperation with the State Department of Education and the State Board of Education, the Office of Education and the
Environment develops and implements a unified education strategy for educating pupils, faculty, and administrators on the
importance of integrating environmental concepts and programs for elementary and secondary schools. The EEI vision
encourages responsible stewardship of the Earth, advances tomorrow's leaders in a changing economy, and positively
impacts the lives of students, families, schools, communities, and California. 
 
3715 - Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction 
 
CalRecycle administers the Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction program with a goal of achieving an 80-
percent recycling rate for glass, aluminum, and plastic beverage containers sold in California. To achieve this goal, the
Division of Recycling ensures the following: (1) the California Redemption Value (CRV) is paid by beverage distributors for
each beverage sold in California; (2) consumers are refunded CRV for recycled beverage containers; (3) recycling centers
are conveniently located; (4) grants are made to encourage recycling and development of markets for recycled materials; (5)
strong oversight and enforcement programs are in place to protect the integrity of the Beverage Container Recycling Fund;
and (6) public outreach and private partnerships are promoted.

The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances public health and the environment through
objective scientific evaluation of risks posed by hazardous substances. The Office performs risk assessments for various
regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other state and local agencies, and
provides these programs with the scientific tools and information upon which to base risk management decisions. Distinct
programs focus on assessing health risks, including risks to children and other sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to
chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, hazardous and municipal waste facilities, fish and
shellfish, and sediments in bay and estuarine waters. The Office also evaluates community pollution burdens and
vulnerabilities.
