Legislative,
Judicial, and
Executive
Governmental bodies classified under the
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive section of the
Governor's Budget are either established as
independent entities under the California
Constitution, or are departments with a recognized
need to operate outside of the administrative
oversight and control of an agency secretary.
Constitutionally-established bodies include the
Legislature, Judicial Branch, Governor's Office,
and constitutional officers. This section also
includes such independent entities as the
Inspector General and the California State Lottery.
0110

Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System
Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional
officers, and legislative statutory officers.
The Legislators' Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment
earnings. Between 2000-01 and 2011-12, the Legislators' Retirement System was super-funded and neither the state nor
members were required to contribute. Beginning in 2012-13, contributions resumed for the state and members.
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of
its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,
disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions.
Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November
6, 1990.
Effective January 1, 2013, the Legislators' Retirement System was closed to all new members by the California Public
Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340). New constitutional officers, statutory
officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

Legislative Counsel Bureau
The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members
and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The
legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending as counsel meetings of legislative
committees, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all work is
confidential.
In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative
measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes.
The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the legislative
information system and the processing of legislative measures.
Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the
Legislative Counsel Bureau. The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws
recommended by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these
uniform acts.

Judicial Branch
Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of
the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system.
Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially
unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases.
The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent
funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was
implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This
implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The
county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty
revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments
to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted
by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act
of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the
counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial
Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are
deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of
court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities
based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state.
The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently,
impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United
States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner.
Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For additional information regarding the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see
"Infrastructure Overview."

5 See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. Funds either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the superior courts’ 
state funding in Section 1.
6 See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and 
Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total 
expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total".
7 For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences.  For the current 
year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.
1 Reflects the 2016-17 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the superior courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for Fiscal Year 2016-17. Non-state 
funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc.
2 Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the superior courts. Does not include judges, who are constitutional officers and not court employees.
3 Reflects the budgets of all 58 superior courts based on courts' 2017-18 Schedule 1 submissions as of December 1, 2017.
4 Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.

5. For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to the JBWCF.  For 
the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.
Prior-Year Actual
Current-Year Estimated
1. Includes all Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" as well as Program 0140019 "Trial Court Operations" expenses from all funds, including the Trial Court Trust Fund (TCTF), State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund (IMF), 
General Fund (GF), and Judicial Branch Workers' Compensation Fund (JBWCF).  The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs have a state operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is 
made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel).
2. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" 
display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State 
Trial Court Funding Total". 
4. Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of superior courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training (DRAFT) Program. 
Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel.
3. This reflects judges' compensation paid excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" revenue amounts reported in the Trial 
Court Information section ($115.3 million in 2016-17 and $121.2 million in 2017-18). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura County Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In 
addition, 25 courts in 2016-17 and 24 courts in 2017-18 participate in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0130 - SUPREME COURT
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state
courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the
Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations
for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of
statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the
Supreme Court.
0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL
Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six
District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the
Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law.
0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL
The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21
voting members and 11 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as
the administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation
of the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and
administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges,
technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research.
0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM
The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of
judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real
estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction.
0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING
0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS
This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and
criminal cases. This program includes all allowable trial court administrative costs under Government Code section 77003,
except court-appointed dependency counsel, salaries and benefits of Superior Court judges, compensation for assigned
judges, support for language interpreters, grants, and expenses on behalf of the trial courts.
0150011 - COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNSEL
This program provides funding for court-appointed counsel for children, non-minor dependents and parents in juvenile court
dependency proceedings pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 317, subdivisions (b) and (c), and Government
Code section 77003, subdivision (a)(4).
0150019 - COMPENSATION OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES
This program provides funding for the salaries and state benefits for Superior Court judges.
0150028 - ASSIGNED JUDGES
This program provides support for the salaries and related costs of retired as well as active judges who are assigned by the
Chief Justice to positions in courts which require assistance due to judicial absences or other factors impacting the ability of a
court to avoid case delay.
0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS
This program supports the provision of qualified language interpreters in criminal, juvenile, family and civil proceedings as
required by statute.
0150046 - GRANTS
This program provides funding for government grants providing public services related to the trial courts.

This program provides appropriation for statewide programs and services provided to the court or courts by the Judicial Council
or payment for services or property of any kind contracted for the court or courts or on behalf of the courts by the Judicial
Council, which are paid for or reimbursed by the trial courts. The appropriation also supports the implementation and
administration of the Civil Representation Pilot Program.
0155 - HABEAS CORPUS RESOURCE CENTER
The Habeas Corpus Resource Center provides legal representation for indigent petitioners in death penalty habeas corpus
proceedings before the Supreme Court of California and the federal courts. The Center also recruits and trains attorneys to
expand the pool of private counsel qualified to accept appointments in death penalty habeas corpus proceedings, serves as a
resource to them, and thereby helps to reduce the number of unrepresented indigents on California's death row.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
The Judicial Branch consists of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, trial courts, and the Judicial Council. The Supreme Court
is located in the Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco (101,500 square feet) and the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los
Angeles (7,600 sf). The courts of appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of
approximately 508,000 sf. The trial courts are located in 58 counties statewide, in approximately 500 buildings and 2,100
courtrooms of approximately 14 million sf of usable area and more than 21 million sf of space under Judicial Council
responsibility and management. The facilities of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and trial courts encompass not only the
public courtroom spaces but also the chambers and workspaces where judicial officers and courtroom staff prepare for
proceedings; secure areas, including holding cells; and building support functions. Judicial Council administrative facilities,
occupying approximately 235,000 sf, are located in San Francisco and Sacramento. The Judicial Council consolidated field
offices to realize program efficiencies and cost savings, by closing its Burbank office on June 30, 2017, to consolidate
operations between Sacramento and San Francisco and by closing its Real Estate and Facilities Management field offices to
relocate staff to the court facilities to which they provide service.
MAJOR PROJECT CHANGES
•
Courthouse Construction-The Budget includes $1.3 billion lease revenue bond funds and $32.1 million special funds for the
continuing phases of ten active projects on the Judicial Council's immediate and critical needs list.

Commission on Judicial Performance
The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of
judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California
Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of
California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or
resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees.
In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement.
The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial
misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation
and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal
from office.
The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the
Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,
and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.
Commission members do not receive a salary.

Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and
Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement
System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members.
The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,
compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges
and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing
fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit
payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the
required benefit payments to retired judges.
The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in
1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System
II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final
compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement
System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of
contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined
benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives
contributions from judges equal to 8 percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted
annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund.
Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of
2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2018-19 Governor's Budget.
2/ The 2018 Budget Act estimates 2018-19 state contributions to the Judges' Retirement System II to be $74,359,000.  The 
reduction in the estimate from the 2018-19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act is the result of a decrease in the 
employer contribution rate to the Judges' Retirement System II, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its 
February 2018 meeting.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
Small Business Development Technical Assistance Expansion Program – The Budget includes $23 million General Fund to
establish a program to provide funding to augment existing small business services such as free or low-cost one-on-one
consulting and low-cost training. Of that amount, $17 million is provided each year, for the next five years to technical
assistance centers with a focus on services to underserved business groups, including women, minority, and veteran-owned
businesses and businesses in low-wealth, rural, and disaster-impacted communities. The Budget also includes the
continuation of $3 million in 2018-19 through 2022-23 for Small Business Development Centers' local cash match funding.
The remaining $3 million is one-time local cash match funding targeted for other federal small business technical assistance
centers. Additionally, the program will allocate funding through a competitive grant process.
•

health, health care services, social services, public assistance, health planning and licensing, and rehabilitation. These
programs touch the lives of millions of California's most needy and vulnerable residents. The HHSA is committed to striking a
balance between maintaining access to essential health and human services for California's most disadvantaged and at-risk
residents while pursuing ways to better manage and control costs.
The following departments and entities fall under the purview of the HHSA:

Office of the Inspector General
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional
system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's
(CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, and the employee disciplinary process. When requested by the Governor,
the Senate Committee on Rules, or the Speaker of the Assembly, the Inspector General reviews the policies, practices, and
procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the
state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the state's juvenile facilities, and conducts metric-oriented
inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at each state prison. OIG receives communications from
individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-free public telephone number to receive allegations of
wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; conducts formal reviews of complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper
management where a legally cognizable cause of action is present; and reviews the mishandling of sexual abuse incidents
within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the state correctional system by publicly reporting
its findings.
In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (Board) that examines CDCR's various mental
health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for inmates and parolees. The Board meets at least twice
annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of offender rehabilitation and treatment programs. The Board
also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of
treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of offenders, gaps in offender rehabilitation services, and levels of offender participation
and success.

Office of Emergency Services
The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (OES) is to protect lives and property, build capabilities, and
support our communities for a resilient California. The OES Director serves as both the Governor's Homeland Security Advisor
and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's homeland security and counter-
terrorism strategy. The OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting against, responding to,
recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of all hazards and threats.
On a day-to-day basis, the OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and
coordinates with federal agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector
resources in emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on
its own resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. The OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those
of the federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California.
During an emergency, the OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's
responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal
assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, the OES is responsible for the
development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes
prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.
The OES implements the state homeland security strategy by overseeing the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which
includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center (STAC). The STAS is comprised of four regional and one major
urban area Fusion Centers that assist in the detection, prevention, investigation, and response to criminal and terrorist activity;
and information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. The STAC
operates as the state's information-sharing clearinghouse for strategic threat analysis, counter-terrorism, situational awareness
reporting, and case analysis for statewide leadership, agencies, and public safety community. Further, the OES improves the
criminal justice system in California by providing financial and technical assistance to local governments, state agencies, and
the private sector for homeland security, public safety, and victim services.
Because the OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the OES has a capital outlay program to support this
need. For the specifics on the OES' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES
Through the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program, the OES provides effective use of federal,
state, and local resources, through the mutual aid system to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended in a
disaster situation. Also, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-hazards
approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National Strategy on
Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this program,
the OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to all
hazards.
0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT
The OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services
grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland
Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, the OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency
management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant
management role, the OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with
financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center which is the
centerpiece of the State's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion
center.
0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS
Public Safety Communications (PSC) serves the State of California by providing public safety communications to the State's
first responders and oversight of the 9-1-1 system to the people of California. The PSC is dedicated to the preservation and
protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services keeping the public
connected during times of crisis.
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE
The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of the OES and support services such as
accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.

months to formulate policies and to incorporate them in the various programs included in the Budget, which will be transmitted
to the Legislature.
The law also provides for the outgoing Governor to appoint persons for up to a two-month period, to assist in concluding
matters arising from official duties during the last term of office.
Of the $1,000,000 budgeted, $865,000 is for the Governor-elect and $135,000 is for the outgoing Governor.

Office of the Lieutenant Governor
Under California's Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor serves as Acting Governor whenever the Governor is absent from the
state, and automatically becomes Governor if a vacancy occurs in the Office of Governor. The Lieutenant Governor is also
President of the Senate and votes in case of a tie.
The Lieutenant Governor serves as a voting member of the Board of Regents of the University of California and a voting
member of the Board of Trustees of the California State University system.
The Lieutenant Governor also serves on, and rotates with the State Controller, as chair of the three-member State Lands
Commission, which oversees the control and leasing of millions of acres of state-owned land, including offshore oil resources,
as well as use and permitting for all navigable waterways in California. The Commission also manages state land-use planning
and revenues, and related interstate issues. During alternate years, when the Lieutenant Governor serves as Chairperson of
the State Lands Commission, he also serves as a member of the Ocean Protection Council.
In addition, under state statutes, the Lieutenant Governor chairs the California Commission for Economic Development, which
provides support and guidance to the Governor, Legislature and private sector regarding the development of California's
economy.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0435 - LEGAL SERVICES
Legal Services is organized into three elements: (1) Civil Law, (2) Criminal Law, and (3) Public Rights.
Civil Law represents the State of California and its officers, agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and employees in
civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them and prosecutes cases to vindicate state
interests. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases before administrative
tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the United States and
California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of eight sections: Business and Tax; Correctional Law; Employment and
Administrative Mandates; Government Law; Health, Education and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement; Licensing; or Tort and
Condemnation.
Criminal Law represents the state in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts. Criminal Law also fulfills the
Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are recused, conducts criminal
investigations, represents the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole decisions and conditions of
confinement in the state prisons and defends state and federal habeas corpus matters. Additional responsibilities include
enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition matters, investigating and prosecuting Medi-Cal
provider fraud, investigating and prosecuting the abuse or neglect of elder and dependent adults residing in long-term health
care facilities, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving white-collar crime, high-tech/computer/privacy
crime, financial crimes against the elderly, human trafficking, environmental crimes, and public corruption.
Public Rights protects and preserves the public interest by providing legal services to state agencies and Constitutional Officers
and by bringing actions in the name of the Attorney General to protect the public. Public Rights provides specialized services in
the following areas: Civil Rights Enforcement (including Underground Economy and the Bureau of Children's Justice);
Charitable Trusts (including the Registry of Charitable Trusts); Natural Resources Law; Corporate Fraud (including False
Claims, Energy and Corporate Responsibility); Indian and Gaming Law; Environment Law; Land Law; Consumer Law
(including Sellers of Travel and Privacy Enforcement and Protection); Antitrust Law; and Tobacco Litigation Enforcement.
0440 - LAW ENFORCEMENT
The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five elements: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3)
Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief.
The Bureau of Firearms provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms/dangerous weapon
laws by conducting firearms eligibility background checks and administering over thirty different state-mandated firearms-
related programs. The Bureau conducts firearms dealer and manufacturer inspections and provides training as needed. Special
Agents conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of weapons.
Agents also conduct firearms investigations to prevent illegal gun trafficking at in-state and out-of-state gun shows in
accordance with state and federal law.
The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and analysis of physical evidence, including crime scene
investigation and expert court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts, by
operating 11 specialized laboratories that serve 46 counties as well as a forensic training facility. BFS maintains the state DNA
laboratory database which compiles DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees.
The Bureau of Gambling Control regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted honestly and
is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of individuals and
business entities who apply for state gambling licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance
with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. Furthermore, the Bureau conducts criminal investigations in, on or
about Tribal casinos and California cardrooms. The Bureau also regulates Tribal gaming to ensure that each Tribe is in
compliance with all aspects of the negotiated gaming compact.
The Bureau of Investigation is the premiere investigative agency that is responsible for exploiting and dismantling criminal
organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses which present a significant and multi-
jurisdictional threat to California. The Bureau prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal organizations involved in
gangs and human trafficking, as well as cases involving environmental crimes, public corruption, major fraud, underground
economy, and high-technology crimes. In addition, the Bureau serves a principal role in providing leadership, coordination, and
support to law enforcement through multi-agency drug, gang and major crimes task forces statewide.

State Controller
The State Controller is the Chief Fiscal Officer of California, the fifth largest economy in the world. Principally responsible for
transparency and accountability of the state's financial resources, the Controller ensures the appropriate disbursement and
tracking of taxpayer dollars. The Controller serves on dozens of state boards, commissions, and committees with duties
ranging from administrative oversight of the nation's two largest public pension funds, to protection of state lands and
coastlines, and modernization and financing of major infrastructure. The Controller also offers fiscal guidance to local
governments and has independent auditing authority over government agencies related to the spending of state funds. The
Controller's primary objectives are to:
•
Account for and control disbursement of all state funds, issuing warrants in payment of the state's bills, including lottery
prizes.
•
Determine legality and accuracy of financial claims against the state.
•
Audit state and local government programs.
•
Safeguard many types of assets until claimed by the rightful owners, in accordance with the Unclaimed Property Law.
•
Inform the public of the state's financial condition.
•
Inform the public of financial transactions of city, county, and other local governments.
•
Administer the Uniform State Payroll System.
•
Audit and process all personnel and payroll transactions for state civil service, state exempt employees, state university
employees, and college system employees.

Department of Insurance
California's publicly-elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the sixth largest insurance economy in the world with insurers
collecting more than $289 billion in premium annually in California while protecting consumers and the integrity, health and
vitality of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is "Insurance Protection for All
Californians." CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in their dealings with
insurers, and using innovation to improve services for insurance producers and consumers.
The CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, the CDI oversees and licenses
approximately 1,300 insurance companies and more than 400,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents,
brokers, adjusters and bail agents. Additionally, the CDI receives and investigates approximately 200,000 consumer inquiries
and complaints annually; performs examinations to ensure the financial solvency of companies; receives more than 28,000
suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually; receives and reviews approximately 7,250 rate filing applications annually; and
works in conjunction with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute fraudulent insurance
practices.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0520 - REGULATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCERS
The objectives of this program are to: (1) prevent losses to policyholders, beneficiaries or the public due to the insolvency of
insurers; (2) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurers as defined by the Insurance Code; (3) ensure that property and
casualty insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the Insurance Code
and the California Code of Regulations; (4) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are
reasonable and attempt to get unreasonable rates lowered by insurers; and (5) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses,
and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Through the Conservation and
Liquidation Office, the CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies.
0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION
The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders
and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating or
underwriting by insurers and (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful or fraudulent practices or
incompetence relating to the sale of insurance and (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved communities.
0530 - FRAUD CONTROL
The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for
prosecution or adjudication those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed
by sworn peace officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program also
implements the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower
"qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud.

collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

California State Lottery Commission
In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an
initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it
broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to
benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by
the State Senate.
The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34
percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be
used for administrative costs.
In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost
limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of
contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery
Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily
Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the
University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind.
In the 32 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2017, the California State Lottery has raised $32.5 billion
for public education, including $1.55 billion in FY 2016-17.
Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2017-18 and 2018-19 cannot be made
with certainty.

State Board of Equalization
Prior to July 1, 2017, the State Board of Equalization (BOE) administered a variety of tax and fee programs including the Sales
and Use tax, as required by statute. The BOE also adjudicated appeals for these tax and fee programs including income tax.
Pursuant to Chapter 16, Statutes of 2017, (AB 102) most statutory duties formerly assigned to the BOE were shifted to the
newly created California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) and the Office of Tax Appeals.
The BOE now handles only those duties assigned to it by the California Constitution, and three statutorily prescribed property
tax programs. The BOE's duties primarily include assessing and allocating the property values of railroads and specified
utilities and businesses; adjudicating property tax appeals of taxable government owned property; overseeing the property tax
assessment practices of the 58 county assessors; adopting rules to clarify property tax laws; and administering the alcoholic
beverage excise tax and the insurance tax, including appeals. The BOE contracts with the CDTFA to administer the alcoholic
beverage tax and insurance tax program.

Notary Public and Special Filings.
Business Entities examines, files, and maintains formation documents for new California business entities and qualifies out-of-

of domestic or qualified foreign business entities to ensure the business entities are properly formed, merged, converted,
amended, and dissolved in compliance with California law. Statements of Information containing key officers and contact
information are also processed and maintained for public and governmental use.
Uniform Commercial Code files certain financing statements allowing lending institutions to protect their financial interest in
personal property and established priority in case of debtor default or bankruptcy. Notices of judgment liens, attachment liens,
agricultural liens, and equipment liens are also filed in Uniform Commercial Code, as well as notices of various tax liens
submitted by state and federal taxing agencies such as the Franchise Tax Board and the Internal Revenue Service.
Notary Public and Special Filings appoints and commissions qualified notaries public for four- year terms, reviews and
approves notary public education courses, and certifies to the authenticity of signatures of notaries public and public officials on
documents for use in foreign countries. Special Filings include trademarks and service marks as well as surety bonds that
certain business entities are required to file, notices of joint power agreements, city and county charters, and claims for
successor-in-interest. This area also has disciplinary functions with regard to notaries public and immigration consultants.
The Advance Health Care Directive (AHCD) Registry maintains AHCDs, which allow a person to indicate his/her medical
treatment preferences if he/she cannot speak or make decisions for him/herself. The AHCD also may designate someone else
to make decisions regarding medical treatment. AHCDs and related information can be provided upon request to the
registrant's health care provider, public guardian, or legal representative.
The Domestic Partners Registry registers same-sex couples regardless of the age of the partners, and opposite-sex couples in
which one partner is at least 62 years old, as domestic partners in California.
The Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund provides limited restitution to victims of corporate fraud who are unable to
collect through other means on a judgment against a corporation for corporate fraud.
Safe at Home is a confidential mail forwarding program designed to assist victims of domestic violence and human trafficking,
sexual assault, stalking, or a reproductive healthcare employee, patient, or volunteer. Participants in the Safe at Home program
are provided with a free post office box to use as a substitute mailing address, thereby protecting their actual residential

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES
The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption.
During the 2016-17 fiscal year, this Division handled 7,697 security investment transactions totaling $339.2 billion. The Pooled
Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 5,926 of these transactions totaling $295 billion; time deposits
accounted for 1,395 transactions totaling $34.2 billion. The remaining $10 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special
funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's
retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment
program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the
2016-17 fiscal year, 2,439 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $21.8 billion for the fiscal year.
0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT
In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System
(CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires
the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,
giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits,
and loans to the General Fund.
The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of
the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that
the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer
maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for
the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies.
The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts
available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer
of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for
payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities
pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other
state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or
pledged to the state.
0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE
The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes,
revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The
Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to
bondholders through the Investor Relations Program.
The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to state debt so there is no adverse consequences to
bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance for various state debt includes
monitoring the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial
disclosure, and ensuring proper record keeping.
0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES
The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support
services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems,
business services, technical support, and production operations.
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES
As of the 2017-18 Governor's Budget, this program has been consolidated with the Administration and Information Services
Program (0740035).

California Debt Limit Allocation Committee
The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State
of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit,
such as the creation of affordable housing.
The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual
basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by
multiplying the state population by $100. California's limit totaled over $3.92 billion in 2017. (California's limit for the Qualified
Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated separately by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $392
million for 2017.)
The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers
authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state
or federal government.
The Committee administers 10 programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity
bonds, and is responsible for reallocation of Qualified Energy Conservation Bond (QECB) authority, originally provided to
qualified localities, but later waived back to the state. The QECB program was made available through the federal American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It provides tax incentives and lower borrowing costs for local governments and
private entities to promote job creation and economic recovery in areas particularly affected by employment decline. It also
facilitates renewable energy conservation programs and projects throughout the state.
The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the Governor, or
upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE
To lower the cost of financing, specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that
support below-market interest rate mortgage loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that reduce a homebuyer's federal
tax liability. Below is a summary of each program:
Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost for developers of multifamily
rental housing to acquire land and construct new housing or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers
produce affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and
families. Projects that receive an award of bond authority have the right to apply for non-competitive
four-percent tax credits.
Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs to assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes.
Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program
participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations.
Home Improvement and Rehabilitation Bond Program - MRBs or MCCs to assist homeowners with home improvement
financing. Homeowners may improve single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses.
Program participants must meet income limits, and in certain cases, must own a home that falls within the program's
rehabilitation cost and age-of-home limitations.
Extra Credit Home Purchase Program - MRBs or MCCs to assist teachers, principals and other eligible school staff with
purchasing homes.
Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds
issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and
midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their
communities.
Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance solid waste disposal and waste recycling
facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities
they serve to meet mandated requirements to protect and enhance the environment.
Student Loan Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued for either financing direct loans to college students and their
parents, or purchasing bundles of already-originated loans on the secondary market. When used for direct lending programs,
tax-exempt bond allocation allows lenders to pass on interest rate savings to students via below-market interest rate loans.
Beginning Farmer Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to back below-market interest rate loans for agricultural
land, construction improvements, breeder livestock, and equipment for farmers. Eligibility, permissible items, and loan limits are
set by the United States Internal Revenue Code. Under the program, a conduit bond issuer applies to the Committee for an
allocation of Beginning Farmer Bonds. If approved, the issuer brings together farmers, financial institutions, and investors to
negotiate terms of a transaction.
Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance the construction,
renovation, and furnishing of primary and secondary school facilities.
Qualified Energy Conservation Bond Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds or governmental purpose taxable bonds
issued to finance a broad array of qualified conservation purposes such as capital expenditures, research facilities and
research grant programs, mass commuting facilities, public education campaigns and demonstration projects. When issued as
a governmental purpose taxable bond, QECBs provide the issuer with either a direct or tax credit interest subsidy.

0830 - CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCING ADVISORY COMMISSION
The core program area is the Industrial Development Bond Program, under which the Commission serves as the mandatory
approval agency for the local bond issuers. Once potential borrowers (manufacturers and processing companies) apply through
their local government agency for low cost tax-exempt financing, the Commission carefully reviews the public benefits
generated by the proposed project, particularly those benefits associated with job creation, and determines whether these
benefits will significantly outweigh any detrimental public effects. Eligible capital expenditures include the acquisition of land,
building construction, building renovation, and the purchase of machinery and equipment. Bond proceeds also can be used to
cover the cost of architects, engineers, attorneys, permits, and the cost of bond issuance. The local issuer can be a city, county,
economic development authority, or a joint power authority.

California Tax Credit Allocation Committee
The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and
maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California. The Committee does this by forming
partnerships with developers, investors and public entities.
The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years
after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with income and rent restrictions related to the tax credit programs of the
Committee. Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private investors, the Committee helps to create
and maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing.
The Committee consists of seven members, including three voting members and four advisors. The voting members are the
Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor (who may choose the Director of Finance as his or her
representative), and the State Controller. The non-voting (advisory) members are the Director of Housing and Community
Development, the Executive Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and two local government representatives.
One local representative is associated with a city government and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The other is a
county government representative appointed by the Senate Rules Committee.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE
The Federal Program
Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax
incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise
project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and
indexed for inflation. For 2018, each state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.40 per state resident. Additionally, each
state may qualify annually for a share of unused credits in a national pool.
Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the
percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability
annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of
the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project
sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each
year for a ten-year period.
The State LIHTC Program
In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the
federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for
an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax
credit status.
The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2017, was $96.5 million. Investors take the state tax credit
annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period.
Tax-Exempt Bond Financed Program
Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may also receive federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects
must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there
is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. The annual credit available
is based on approximately 4 percent of the qualified basis of the development. The qualified basis includes those costs
attributable to the units that will be income and rent restricted for a minimum of 30 years.
Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years; however, California's program generally requires
maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.
Farmworker Housing Program
Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state
LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017,
these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and
projects may receive state credits even if they receive an increase in their federal tax credit basis.

California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing
Authority
The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes
of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently
utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the
environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by
providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources,
implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and
lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit
enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities
needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies.
The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director
of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission,
and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY
Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the
authority, bond insurance, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as
determined and approved by resolution of the Authority.
In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative
source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010) and subsequently, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2012, expanded
the STE program to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter
768, Statutes of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock
and equipment that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. The objective of this program is to
promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases,
air and water pollution, and energy consumption.
Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013
(Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority
developed a loan loss reserve program to assist financial institutions in making loans to homeowners in the state for residential
whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and developed a risk mitigation program for residential Property
Assessed Clean Energy programs in California.
Most recently, the Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf
of, and in collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission. These energy efficiency financing pilot programs will
employ various types of credit enhancements to encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the residential and
commercial sectors) for energy efficiency improvements needed to help achieve California's energy efficiency goals.

California Pollution Control Financing Authority
California Pollution Control Financing Authority is committed to stimulating local economies in California by making capital more
accessible to small businesses, and delivering innovative financing for projects that protect and restore the environment. The
Authority was created to assist the solid waste, recycling, water, and wastewater industries through its Pollution Control Tax-
Exempt Bond Program. Over the last twenty years, the Authority has evolved to provide financing assistance to California's
small business sector through its California Capital Access Program (CalCAP), and to promote the reuse and redevelopment of
brownfields through the California Recycle Underutilized Sites Program (CALReUSE).
The Authority consists of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the State Controller, and the Director of the Department of
Finance.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM
The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the
acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment,
2018-19 STATE BUDGET — LJE 252
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE

waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority
assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989.
As of June 30, 2017, bonds totaling approximately $15.3 billion have been issued by the Authority.
0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
The objective of this program is to encourage banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses. CalCAP
for Small Businesses is a form of loan loss recovery that may provide up to 100 percent coverage on certain loan defaults. By
participating in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to meet the financing needs of
California's small businesses. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund for each participating
financial institution. The Authority funds this reserve together with the financial institution and the borrower. Additional
incentives are provided to lend to businesses located in specified communities. The reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk,
allowing banks to lend to targeted California small businesses. Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million General
Fund to CalCAP to increase lending efforts. As of June 30, 2017, approximately $1.877 million of the $6 million remained in the
State-funded program account to assist small businesses.
In addition, California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168.6 million from the federal State Small
Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The Authority and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (Go-BIZ)
equally share this allocation of $84.3 million each. These funds have enabled the Authority to expand the availability of its
CalCAP program statewide. The Authority also launched the Collateral Support Program to assist more small businesses and
utilize the SSBCI federal funds. Funds were allocated to California in three installments based on program progress. The
Authority received $27 million in March 2011, $27 million in December 2013, and $29 million in August 2015. The Authority was
allocated an additional $321,000 in December 2016, the final receipt of federal funds under the SSBCI program. As of June 30,
2017, approximately $900,000 remained in the federally-funded program account to assist small businesses under the CalCAP
loan loss reserve program. Approximately $5 million remained in the federally-funded program account for the Collateral
Support Program. Funds are being recaptured to sustain the programs.
Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority has partnered with the Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist diesel truck and
equipment owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $107.3 million in Air Quality Improvement
Program funds towards the purchase or retrofit of diesel trucks to comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The
Authority has also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit
enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers who install electric vehicle charging stations. Similarly, the Authority is
partnering with the Department of Resources, Recycling, and Recovery to assist with the financing of important state recycling
objectives.
0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM
The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived
contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of contaminated properties
(brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program
provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000, which was later increased to $500,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with
brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the development of remedial action plans. Eligible
projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or
perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process.
Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund
brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received
$60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided up to $5 million per project in loans and grants for the purpose of brownfield
cleanup that promotes affordable infill residential and mixed-used development. All CALReUSE Program funds have been
awarded. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will result in 5,618 housing units
in 30 California communities.
0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS
Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative
energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's
environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and
state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority.
0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES ACT
The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for their employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other
financial institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the
Authority an appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the
CalCAP model and create loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program.

0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM
The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time
allocation of $10 million to create an accessible loan program to qualified small businesses and residential property owners
(including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other financial institutions to
participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program. The loans to small
businesses and residential property owners are for financing seismic retrofits of real property to reduce losses and mitigate
seismic damage.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM
In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3
established the second Children's Hospital Program. The purpose of both programs is to improve the health and welfare of
California's critically ill children by providing a stable and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's
hospitals. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750
million under Proposition 61 and $980 million under Proposition 3.
0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES GRANTS AND LOANS
The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health
institutions.
Tax-Exempt Bond Program
Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt, liability, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power of
the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for repayment of
the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation or
association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district.
Lifeline Grant Program
Chapter 52, Statutes of 2017 (SB 97) authorized the Authority to approve grants of up to $20 million dollars from the HELP II
Loan Program subfund account. The Lifeline Grant Program will assist small and rural health facilities, including community-
based clinics, that may be adversely affected financially by a reduction or elimination of federal government assistance and that
have little to no access to working capital. Grants must be awarded by June 30, 2020.
HELP II Loan Program
The Authority administers the Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II (HELP II) to assist small and rural health facilities in
obtaining financing for their capital needs. The HELP II Program provides two percent and three percent fixed interest rate
loans of up to $1,500,000 to California's nonprofit small and rural health facilities in an efficient, timely, and cost effective
manner. The two percent interest rate applies to loans approved from April 30, 2015 - April 30, 2017, and is effective for the life
of the loan. Refinancing loans are not eligible for the two percent interest rate. Refinancing loans are eligible up to $1,000,000.
HELP II loans may be used to purchase or construct new facilities, remodel or renovate existing facilities, purchase equipment
and/or furnishings, and refinance existing debt.
California Health Access Model Program
Chapter 23, Statutes of 2012 (AB 1467) authorized the California Health Access Model Program (CHAMP), a grant program
intended to support innovative methods of delivering health care services and improve health outcomes for vulnerable
populations and communities by bringing services to individuals where they live or congregate.
0890 - MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANTS
Chapter 34, Statutes of 2013 (SB 82), the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 and related legislation provided
$142.5 million in one-time General Fund, and $4 million in ongoing Mental Health Services Act funding to provide grants for
community based mental health crisis support, which may also be eligible for matching federal funding.
The Act established a grant program to disburse funds to California counties or to their nonprofit or public agency designates
for the purpose of developing mental health crisis support programs. Specifically, funds will increase capacity for client
assistance and services in crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, crisis residential treatment, rehabilitative mental health
services, and mobile crisis support teams. The grants will support capital improvement, expansion and limited start-up costs.
Children and Youth Mental Health Wellness Grants
With the passage of Chapter 30, Statutes of 2016 (SB 833), the Children and Youth Investment in Mental Health Wellness
Grant Program was created to increase mental health services for children and youth 21 years of age and under to develop a
complete continuum of crisis services. Working with counties, the program will fund facility acquisition, construction/renovation,
equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs to provide mental health services for children and youth as
well as provide family care throughout the state.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD
On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which
allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can
make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings.
ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability
expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the
State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program (the Program) accounts on behalf of eligible individuals.
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
2018-19 STATE BUDGET — LJE 263
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the
purpose of creating the Program. Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $14,000 during a taxable year,
to a designated beneficiary's ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary.

† The Authority funding is not subject to Budget Act appropriation. This budget is for informational purposes only. The
informational budget presented here reflects the department’s best estimate of the budgets for 2017-18 and 2018-19. Public
Resource Code section 32054 authorizes an Executive Director; however, the position is currently vacant.
LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY
DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY
Public Resources Code, Division 22, Sections 32000-32208.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0900 - The Authority was established to issue up to $650 million in conduit financing to make loans or acquire title to property
and to underwrite or undertake directly a variety of urban waterfront development projects within the coastal zone, the
Sacramento-Yolo Port District, the Stockton Port District, and those metropolitan statistical areas meeting specified conditions.
The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that bonds authorized by the Authority generally be within an allocation from the
state's ''private activity'' bond limit in order for the bonds to be federally tax-exempt, unless the issuer qualifies as a private,
nonprofit business.
Financing is available for both publicly and privately sponsored projects that provide visitor-serving facilities, waterfront-
dependent industries, public recreation, and erosion control facilities. The State Coastal Conservancy must approve both the
specific project and a master plan for urban waterfront restoration before any project can obtain the Authority approval for
revenue bond financing. The Authority has sold $3.33 million in revenue bonds to date.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM
Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance
of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to schools and
community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities,
reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB
2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs.
0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM
Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program
(CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the
Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University
Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50
percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the
state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be
deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements.
0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM
In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded grants under the United States Department of Education's State Charter School
Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs.
Grant funds reimburse a charter school's costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities
or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on
preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, and
demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding.
0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM
The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and
lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged
students. Eligible charter schools are provided up to $1,145 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, not to exceed 75
percent of their total annual facilities rent or lease costs.
0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND
Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of
up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is
available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference is given to schools that
have not completed their full charter term.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
0940 - BOND FINANCING
CEFA issues revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning construct educational facilities. Because
it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, the Authority may be able to provide more favorable financing terms than might
otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the
construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or
the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating
institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private
activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private
college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on his or her race or ethnicity, provided that the financing does
not violate constitutional provisions.
"Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to
issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings than
these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing.
0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND
Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the
tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015,
added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January
1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax
credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.
