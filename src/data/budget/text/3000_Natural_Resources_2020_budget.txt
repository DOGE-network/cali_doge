Natural 
Resources 
Natural Resources Agency programs protect and 
restore California's diverse natural and cultural 
resources for current and future generations, 
including operating state parks, managing water 
supplies, supporting forest health, encouraging 
clean energy, and preserving fish and wildlife 
habitats, rich farmlands and mineral resources. 
Agency programs also protect the public through 
construction of levees in the Central Valley and 
suppression of wildfires. These programs not only 
contribute to the state's unique quality of life, but 
also are critical to sustaining a vibrant economy. 
3100   Exposition Park 
The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are 
located in Exposition Park, a 160-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these 
three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park. 
The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park 
usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of 
the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science related learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, 
preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California 
and the western United States. 
Because the Science Center's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Science Center has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER 
 
Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and 
family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops 
and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 
Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological 
processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering, 
communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its temporary 
home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center - its 
permanent home - is completed. 
In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The 
Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and 
other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a 
Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The 
school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 
The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those 
traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding 
support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation. 
2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT 
The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management 
and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events, 
and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is 
responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of 
park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park 
Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in 
addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood. 
2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM 
The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the 
Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of 
African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African 
American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear 
campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility 
in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public

programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture, 
historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and 
to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at 
large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty 
years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an 
inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.

3125   California Tahoe Conservancy 
The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational 
resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs 
that acquire environmentally sensitive land; provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed restoration; 
and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy balances these activities 
with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by acquiring 
lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 
The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to 
restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.  The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the 
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed 
to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 
Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program 
to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 
The Conservancy owns and manages nearly 4,700 properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of quarter-
acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, and have 
significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple benefits 
and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and encroachments. 
Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental role of the 
Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational amenities, 
including six beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe. 
The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to 
more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a 
wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also 
increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire, 
clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This 
work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change. 
The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site 
improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating 
public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake. 
2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 
This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing 
facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide 
variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds 
such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality. 
In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting 
urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive 
Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town 
center objectives.  Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other 
environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become 
strong workers and citizens. 
In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that 
are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities. 
Because the CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on the CCC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2360 - TRAINING AND WORK PROGRAM 
This Program focuses on four areas: 
Natural Resource Work: Corpsmembers protect and enhance the state's natural resources through park development, trail 
construction, tree planting, fire hazard reduction, watershed improvement, wildlife habitat enhancement, removal of non-native 
vegetation, meadow restoration, energy and water auditing and retrofitting, irrigation system installation, and drought-tolerant 
and other landscaping. 
Disaster Response: Corpsmembers are dispatched to fires, assisting with initial attack, mop-up and logistical support; floods, 
filling sandbags, reinforcing levees and stabilizing hillsides; earthquakes, removing hazards and staffing disaster assistance 
centers; oil spill clean-up; snow removal; search and rescue operations; pest infestation eradication; and homeland security 
assistance. 
Corpsmember Education: Corpsmembers are provided opportunities to advance their academic skills while in the CCC through 
local adult and charter schools and community colleges. 
Corpsmember Development and Training: The CCC stresses the development of both a work and service ethic, which includes 
teamwork, self-discipline, leadership, and giving back to California. Corpsmembers learn conservation principles and career 
planning. The CCC also offers training in trail building, first aid, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, and 
firefighting certification, which can lead to internship opportunities with various employers in California.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 9 residential and 17 non-residential 
facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training, 
and educational opportunities to young men and women. The facilities also allow the CCC to assist federal, state and local 
agencies, as well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources. 
The CCC residential facilities house 80 to 100 corpsmembers each and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people 
together from across the state, and increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential 
centers range in size from 30 to 60 corpsmembers and allow young people with families to live at home and report to work.

The Demand Analysis program is responsible for collecting and analyzing electricity and natural gas consumption data used to 
prepare energy demand forecasts, forecasting peak and total energy consumption by sector, and estimating the amount of 
energy conserved by existing and proposed program activities. The program conducts detailed electricity and natural gas end-
use surveys which serve as a primary data source for energy demand forecasts, conservation potential studies, and market 
and policy impact assessments. The program also performs transportation energy demand forecasting, conducts consumer 
vehicle choice surveys, and assesses the impacts of transportation electrification on California electricity use. 
 
2390 - DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
The Development Program focuses on transportation and alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. The mission is to support 
provision of adequate and reliable transportation energy to the California transportation sector while balancing economic, public 
health, safety, and environmental consequences. The program also conducts research, development, demonstration, 
commercialization, and deployment activities on energy efficiency, renewable and advanced energy technologies, and 
alternative and renewable fuel and advanced vehicle technologies so that future energy supplies are cost effective, secure, and 
reliable; enhance environmental quality; and promote state and local economic development. The program provides technical 
assistance, financial assistance, direct technology research and demonstration, technology forecasting, technology analysis 
and evaluation, and information transfer. 
2390010 - Transportation Technology and Fuels 
 
The Transportation Technology and Fuels program provides financial incentives to develop and deploy innovative technologies 
and strategies that transform California's fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state's climate change policies. The program 
goal is the development and deployment of low-carbon alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies in the marketplace, 
without adopting any one preferred fuel or technology. The program provides analyses and recommendations to guide state 
energy policy and legislation to achieve climate change and air quality objectives, reduce petroleum consumption, and promote 
economic development. The program also provides incentives to workforce development and training that intersect with the 
respective program goals.

The Research and Development program develops, and helps bring to market, the clean energy solutions needed for the 
energy system of the future - a system that is cleaner, less environmentally impactful, more reliable, more resilient, more 
affordable, and from which these benefits are delivered equitably. The program invests in the creation, refinement, 
demonstration, and market facilitation of clean energy technology through strategic, performance-based competitive 
solicitations. Often attracting private and further public-sector investments, these solicitations spur innovation and advancement 
by making possible research, demonstration, and development projects that directly address current and emerging energy 
system challenges. Californians realize benefits from robust, stable, thoughtful, and directed investments in energy efficiency 
and demand response, advanced generation, energy storage, strategies to reduce or mitigate energy-related environmental 
impact, transportation technologies, and energy transmission and distribution system improvements. 
2390028 - Renewable Energy 
 
The Renewable Energy program fosters growth of the renewable energy market by providing financial incentives to support the 
development and use of eligible renewable energy products; requiring utilities to disclose information to consumers on their 
power fuel mix; implementing the Renewables Portfolio Standard; and establishing solar equipment rating standards and 
maintaining solar equipment lists meeting the performance and safety standards. 
2395 - LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM 
 
The Loan Repayment program consists of Conservation and Development program loan repayments deposited into the 
following accounts: State Energy Conservation Assistance Account; Local Jurisdiction Energy Assistance Account; Energy 
Technologies Research, Development and Demonstration Account; and Local Government Geothermal Resources Revolving 
Subaccount.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 
This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 
tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and 
the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal, 
state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about 
land use, seismic safety, and mineral development. 
2425 - GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as much 
as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and 
environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of 
hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for 
program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries.    
2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION 
This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program 
provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local 
governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts 
for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development 
rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops

maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to assist in local land use 
decisions. 
2435 - MINE RECLAMATION 
This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface 
Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim 
mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and 
remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety. 
2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD 
The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of 
mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine 
Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans, 
and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to 
comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local 
government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the 
property and resources of California. 
CAL FIRE provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue and disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership 
in the protection of life, property, and natural resources. 
CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety 
programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency 
response. 
CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing 
diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention 
awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management. 
CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to 
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland 
areas of California. 
Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• CAL FIRE Relief Staffing and Additional Surge Capacity—$85.6 million General Fund ongoing for additional firefighting 
resources to provide CAL FIRE with operational flexibility throughout the peak fire season and beyond as fire conditions 
dictate. These resources will be leveraged to provide relief for frontline firefighting staff, which will directly benefit employee 
health and wellness. Additionally, these resources will serve as an immediate resource pool to be deployed strategically, 
based on fire risk, to build CAL FIRE’s surge capacity by staffing additional engines during the late fall, winter, and early 
spring, and adding a fourth firefighter on a portion of engines. 
• Innovation Procurement Sprint—$4.4 million General Fund ($7.6 million ongoing) to enable CAL FIRE to implement the new, 
pioneering wildfire prediction and modeling technology that was procured through the Innovation Procurement Sprint process 
initiated through Executive Order N-04-19. The recently-executed contract will enable CAL FIRE to access a wildfire 
predictive software program that will be used to inform fire pre-positioning and suppression tactical operations, with the intent 
to more readily control and contain wildfires, and to protect people and assets at risk.

Fireworks Disposal. This division's primary functions are licensing, product approval, fire/explosion investigations and 
licensing enforcement. 
• Pipeline Safety: This program oversees the safe construction, operation and maintenance of approximately 6,500 miles of 
intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines that transport crude oil, refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc.), and Highly 
Volatile Liquids (HVL) throughout California, including, but not limited to, populated urban areas, ecologically sensitive areas, 
and other high consequence areas. Pipelines that fall under the Pipeline Safety Division authority are pipelines that transport 
hazardous liquids between facilities, such as offshore platforms, production fields, refineries, storage terminals, and marine 
terminals. The OSFM regulated pipelines do not include those within production fields, marine terminals, or refineries. 
• State Fire Training: This program administers the California Fire Service Training and Education System and the Fire Service 
Training and Education Program for federal, state and local firefighters. The program oversees a California Fire Academy 
System, which consists of over 50 training academies that are administered through partnerships between fire departments, 
community colleges, and the OSFM. The State Fire Training Program administers a professional certification system for 
firefighters and chief officers and receives program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services. 
2461019 - California Underground Facilities Safe Excavation Board: 
The Dig Safe Board was created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661) to work on issues related to the 
state's "Call Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators and buried infrastructure owners to coordinate to prevent 
infrastructure damage and unsafe outcomes. The Dig Safe Board is charged with coordinating the state’s safe excavation 
outreach and education efforts, developing safe excavation standards, investigating accidents, and working with partner state 
agencies to enforce the “Call Before You Dig” law. 
2465 - FIRE PROTECTION 
CAL FIRE provides fire protection services to help limit damages to life, property, and natural resources. The objective is to 
quickly and aggressively attack fires in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct protection responsibility by virtue of 
law, contract, or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial attack and follow-up action is relative to values 
threatened and control difficulty, with the goal to control all unwanted fires under CAL FIRE's jurisdiction within the first 
operational period. 
2465010 - Fire Prevention: 
This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression 
cost recovery, and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials, and procedures to 
mitigate hazards and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to be 
done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of firefighting, property loss, injury to the public and firefighters, 
and damage to the environment. 
2465019 - Fire Control: 
The objective of this program is to detect, respond to, and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility 
Area using an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 10 acres or less. This 
is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews, bulldozers, helicopters, 
and fixed wing aircraft. 
2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection: 
CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state, and federal agencies throughout California 
through the administration of over 100 cooperative government agreements. Additionally, there are six long standing 
agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of CAL FIRE. 
2465037 - Conservation Camps: 
CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, operates 39 conservation camps throughout 
the state that house 196 fire crews. CAL FIRE also operates four Fire Centers with the California Conservation Corps 
throughout the state that house 12 fire crews. These crews provide one of the primary labor forces for firefighting, emergency 
response, and conservation related work projects. 
2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 
CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope 
with a wildland fire within the initial attack period. Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was 
incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management

through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes. 
2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands, and urban forests provide multiple human, climate, and 
environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to 
these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by the regulation of timber harvesting, 
coordination of climate related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial landowners, operation of 
state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects, and administration of federal 
forestry assistance programs. 
2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement: 
The objective of this program is to improve forest lands and urban forests. Activities include: (1) pest detection, evaluation, and 
management; (2) growing and selling tree seedlings for reforestation, carbon sequestration, and soil erosion control; (3) 
maintenance of a native conifer seed bank; (4) advice and assistance to non-industrial forest landowners on the management 
of forests and improved harvesting and conservation practices; (5) research on and demonstration of sustainable forestry in 
state forests; (6) implementation of the California Forest Improvement Act of 1978; (7) technical assistance and grants to foster 
the environmental, social, and economic benefits of urban forests consistent with the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978; 
and (8) purchasing and monitoring working forest conservation easements per the California Forest Legacy Act of 2008. In the 
area of vegetation management, assistance is provided to public and private landowners to achieve land use objectives by 
reducing damage from wildland fires, increasing wildlife habitat, increasing productivity of forest and rangelands, improving 
water yields and air quality, reducing carbon emissions from wildland fires, increasing firefighter safety, and maintaining 
desirable ecosystems. 
CAL FIRE cooperates with federal, state, and local agencies; local organizations; and private property owners to develop and 
achieve land use objectives. Activities include removal, rearrangement, conversion, or improvement of vegetation using various 
treatment measures such as prescribed fire and mechanical, manual, and biological methods. The Environmental Protection 
Program provides in-house expertise and oversight of the Department's compliance with the California Environmental Quality 
Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other environmental laws and regulations applicable to departmental actions. 
2470019 - Forest Practice Regulations: 
The objective of this program is to maximize sustained production of high-quality timber products while protecting soil, water, 
wildlife, recreation, and other values associated with forested lands. Forest Practice activities include the review and permitting 
of commercial timber harvesting operations on nonfederal timberlands, enforcing state forest practice laws and regulations, and 
monitoring compliance and the effects of timber operations on forest productivity, water quality, watersheds, soils, botanical 
resources, wildlife, fisheries, greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmentally sensitive resources. The Program is also 
responsible for issuing licenses to timber operators (LTOs), providing LTO training and education, and assisting the Board of 
Equalization-Timber Tax Division in their administration of taxes on timber and timberland. 
2470028 - Forest Resource Inventory and Assessment: 
The objective of this program is to perform a periodic assessment of California's forest and rangeland resources. Activities 
include maintaining and distributing mission-critical data sets for fire planning, emergency incident support, and meeting certain 
regulatory requirements. In addition, the program provides extensive technical and public information regarding statewide fire 
threats, fire hazards, watersheds, various environmental indicators, and urban forestry. 
2470037 - Professional Foresters Registration Program: 
The Office of Professional Foresters Registration is a statutorily authorized program within the State Board of Forestry and Fire 
Protection. The program is responsible for the licensing and regulation of all persons who practice forestry on non-federal, 
state, and private lands in California pursuant to the Professional Foresters Law of 1972. The program also licenses “certified 
specialties” of forestry, with the single certified specialty currently being Certified Rangeland Managers. 
2475 - BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION 
The Board of Forestry and Fire Protection is a Governor-appointed body within CAL FIRE. The Board is responsible for 
developing the general forest policy of the state, determining the guidance policies of CAL FIRE, and representing the state's 
interest in federal forests in California. Together, the Board and CAL FIRE work to carry out statutory mandates to protect and 
enhance the state's unique forest and wildland resources. The Board's statutory responsibilities are to:

3560   State Lands Commission 
The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its 
care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access. 
Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars in 
revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources. 
Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands 
Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign 
public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal 
government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands 
legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage responsible development, environmental 
preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law Public Trust 
Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the trust. 
Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and 
lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high 
water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands, 
which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California. 
School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the 
five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state 
ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest 
in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Mineral Resources Management Division oversees efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands. 
The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the 
safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas, 
geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public 
safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources 
through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also promulgates regulations for the prevention of oil spills and 
the safe operation of offshore facilities and conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives fair value for 
the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the oil and gas 
facilities under its jurisdiction. 
Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-
generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects, and also coordinates with other agencies to administer the 
statewide Abandoned Mines program. 
2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural 
and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public 
Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from Lake 
Tahoe and the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast in the west, and include California’s 
two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin. 
Under the Land Management Program, the Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California 
Legislature to approximately 70 local jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including 
the state’s five major ports. The Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for 
use or development, preserving and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands.

Finally, the Commission administers the state’s school lands, which seeks to develop and consolidate the state’s school-land 
holdings to the economic benefit of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. 
2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION 
The Marine Environmental Protection Division adopts rules, regulations, and guidelines for marine oil terminals within 
California, providing the best achievable protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Division monitors 
the transfer of oil at marine terminals, inspects all marine facilities, and reviews and approves all marine oil terminal operations 
manuals and training and certification programs. The Division also administers Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to 
ensure that marine oil terminals are fit for their purpose, and implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to 
prevent the introduction of nonindigenous species into California waters through the operations of oceangoing vessels. The 
program funds and conducts scientific research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, 
and physically inspects oceangoing vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management 
actions. 
9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction, and administrative support to the 
Commission’s line programs.

3600   Department of Fish and Wildlife 
The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the 
habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological value and for their use and enjoyment by the public.

This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to protect the survival of all species and 
natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational, 
commercial, scientific, and educational uses. 
Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2590 - BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROGRAM 
This program encourages the preservation, conservation, maintenance, and restoration of wildlife resources, including the 
Ecosystem Restoration Program, under the jurisdiction and influence of the state. Activities involve the conservation, protection 
and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat to ensure maintenance of biologically sustainable populations of 
those species. 
2595 - HUNTING, FISHING, AND PUBLIC USE PROGRAM 
This program facilitates diverse and sustainable hunting, fishing (recreational and commercial), trapping, and other public uses 
and associated economic benefits to the state by conserving and managing game species. Activities include collection and 
assessment of information on the distribution and abundance of game fish and wildlife to determine appropriate regulations 
(bag limits, gear restrictions, etc.) and to monitor the effects of those regulations. 
2600 - MANAGEMENT OF DEPARTMENT LANDS AND FACILITIES PROGRAM 
This program manages Department-owned or leased lands and facilities, including hatcheries, wildlife areas, ecological 
reserves, fish and wildlife laboratories, and public access areas, to contribute to the conservation, protection, and management 
of fish and wildlife. 
2605 - ENFORCEMENT 
This program serves the public through law enforcement, public safety and hunter education. Law enforcement promotes 
compliance with laws and regulations protecting fish and wildlife resources; and investigates habitat destruction, pollution 
incidents and illegal commercialization of wildlife. Wardens also serve the public through general law enforcement, mutual aid 
and homeland security. 
2610 - COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH PROGRAM 
This program provides resource conservation education and activities in the classroom and on public and private lands; 
community and stakeholder outreach; and information and data using a variety of methods including publications, 
presentations, web applications, and media relations. 
2615 - SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM 
This program minimizes damage and environmental impacts to, restores, and rehabilitates California's fish and wildlife 
populations and their habitats from the harmful effects of oil and other deleterious material spills in marine waters and inland 
habitats. 
2620 - FISH AND GAME COMMISSION 
The California Fish and Game Commission ensures the long term sustainability of California's fish and wildlife resources by 
guiding the ongoing scientific evaluation and assessment of California's fish and wildlife resources; setting California's fish and 
wildlife resource management policies and ensuring these are implemented by the Department of Fish and Wildlife; 
establishing appropriate fish and wildlife resource management rules and regulations; and building active fish and wildlife 
resource management partnerships with individual landowners, the public and interest groups, and federal, state and local 
resource management agencies.

3720   California Coastal Commission 
The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed by the Governor, the Senate Rules 
Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the 
California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and 
recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources; 
and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. The Commission is also designated the 
principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone Management Act in 
California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal development projects, 
and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be subject to state control.

3790   Department of Parks and Recreation 
The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and 
education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most 
valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and 
future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the 
major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural 
resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park 
visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and 
water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, 
jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds, 
plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing 
financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies. 
Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional 
authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance the San Francisco Bay, and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive

managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. By 
statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay and

The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department 
evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs, and explores potential solutions to meet the state’s growing 
needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to 
prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its 
efficient use. 
 
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 
The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water 
resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to 
consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water 
conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water 
supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan 
identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation, 
recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration, 
groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected 
catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare 
integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure 
sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development, 
protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water Element for their 
General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local agencies and 
tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination. 
3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 
The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21 
pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals, 
pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. 
The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water 
to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County. 
The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe, 
timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental 
commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and 
federal regulations and permits. 
3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE 
This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper 
construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include 
assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use 
of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities, 
coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in 
cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way 
for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and the 
reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities 
associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The 
program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety. 
3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD 
The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC), 
designated floodways, and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by 
issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that 
protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large 
joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies that operate

and maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for 
stakeholders. 
3255 - SERVICES 
This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning, 
development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory; 
information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies. 
3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING 
California Energy Resources Scheduling is responsible for managing the Electrical Power Fund and the Department of Water 
Resources (DWR) Charge Fund. For a limited period of time, the Electrical Power Charge Fund purchased electric power on 
behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. The Department retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering 
revenue bonds issued to repay the General Fund for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and 
funding of reserve accounts necessary to maintain an investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.  The 
DWR Charge Fund will manage the collection of bond charges from ratepayers of Investor-Owned Utility companies, and 
proceeds from issuance of bonds.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control 
system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage 
facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 
miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated 
farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate 
reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the 
Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank 
protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs, 
pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood 
protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

3885   Delta Stewardship Council 
Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is 
to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and 
enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and 
enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted 
a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta. 
Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other 
relevant agencies. In 2019, the Council completed its five-year review of the Delta Plan as required under state law. The 
Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent Science Board. The mission 
of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to inform water and environmental 
decisionmaking in the Delta.
