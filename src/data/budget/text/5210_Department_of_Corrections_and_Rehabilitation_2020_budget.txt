MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Adult Inmate and Parolee Population—Compared to the 2019 Budget Act, the adult inmate average daily population is 
projected to decrease by 3,335 in 2020-21, to a total of 122,536. Compared to 2019-20 at the 2019 Budget Act, the 2020 
Budget Act projects an increase in the average daily parolee population of 1,432 in 2020-21, to a total of 51,874. 
• Light Duty and Modified Work Assignments—The Budget includes $16.7 million General Fund annually for two years to 
provide modified work assignment posts for staff with medical conditions, such as pregnancy, to provide them opportunities 
to continue working or return to work earlier than would otherwise be possible. 
• Reduce Reception Center Process to 30 days—The Budget includes reductions of $3.7 million General Fund and $121,000 
Inmate Welfare Fund due to anticipated savings by implementing a more efficient process at the reception centers. It is 
anticipated to reduce the current processing time of 90 to 120 days down to as little as 30 days. This will allow inmates to 
begin participating in academic and rehabilitative programs sooner. 
• Changes to Good Conduct Credits—The Budget includes reductions of $2.7 million General Fund and $170,000 Inmate 
Welfare Fund due to anticipated changes in good conduct credits, applied prospectively. 
• Consolidate Fire Camps—The Budget includes reductions of $7.4 million General Fund due to the consolidation of eight fire 
camps that are currently not at capacity. CDCR will work with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL 
FIRE) on the selection of the specific camps, taking into consideration proximity to other fire camps in an effort to minimize 
impacts to communities that rely on the services provided by inmate fire crews. 
• Intake Cell Retrofits for Suicide Prevention—The Budget includes $3.8 million one-time General Fund to retrofit 64 intake

cells across the state to provide a safer environment for inmates entering segregated housing. 
• Eliminate the Integrated Services for Mentally Ill Parolee Program—The Budget includes a reduction of $8.1 million General 
Fund to eliminate the Integrated Services for Mentally Ill Parolee (ISMIP) program. The ISMIP program provides wraparound 
services, including some transitional housing, for approximately 1,500 of 18,000 mentally ill parolees. However, the program 
is costly and has shown limited effectiveness at reducing recidivism.  The Department will adjust policies to connect these 
individuals with community resources, which ultimately provide better continuity of care long-term. Although the Budget 
reduces funding for the program, statutory changes are necessary to eliminate the program. 
• Suspension of the Transition-Aged Youth Pilot in the Division of Juvenile Justice—The Budget includes a reduction of $3.1 
million ongoing General Fund to suspend the seven-year pilot program operated by the Division of Juvenile Justice to divert 
transition-aged youth from adult prison to a juvenile facility. Currently, there is only one participant in the program who meets 
the statutory criteria and, given the costs of the program, the pilot is not an effective use of resources. Although the Budget 
reduces funding for this program, statutory changes are necessary to suspend the pilot. 
• Division of Juvenile Justice Transition—The Governor’s Budget proposed to transfer the Division of Juvenile Justice to a 
newly created independent department within the Health and Human Services Agency. The May Revision proposed instead 
to transfer the responsibility for managing all youth to local jurisdictions and direct a portion of the state savings to county 
probation departments. The Budget reflects the reversal of the transition, while the remainder of the proposal to realign youth 
to counties will continue to be discussed over the next few months. 
• Cap Parole Terms—The Budget includes a reduction of $23.2 million General Fund to establish supervision terms for certain 
parolees at 24 months and establish earned discharge processes for non-Penal Code section 290 registrants at 12 months. 
The Budget includes a reduction of funding associated with this proposal. However, statutory changes are necessary to 
implement the proposal and realize these projected savings. 
• Reduce Ongoing Prison Maintenance Funding—The Budget includes a reduction of $18.5 million ongoing General Fund to 
provide less ongoing funding for prison maintenance projects in light of the current fiscal conditions. 
• Restructure of Equal Opportunity Complaints Program—The Budget includes $943,000 General Fund to expand the 
Department’s equal opportunity complaint processes to promote objectivity and fairness in complaint investigations. 
• Roof Replacements—The Budget includes $37.6 million General Fund for necessary roof replacement projects at California 
State Prison, Sacramento. 
• Psychiatry Registry Funding Augmentation—The Budget includes $13.3 million ongoing General Fund for contract psychiatry 
services needed to meet the federal court order to fill at least 90 percent of the state prison system’s psychiatry positions. 
• Expansion of Statewide Telepsychiatry Program—The Budget includes $5.9 million General Fund in 2020-21, increasing to 
$8.4 million ongoing General Fund in 2024-25, to provide increased staffing and infrastructure support for the Statewide 
Telepsychiatry Program. The use of telepsychiatry through secure videoconferencing has improved access to mental health 
care services, particularly for patients at remote institutions. 
• Legionella Remediation at California Health Care Facility—The Budget includes $9.7 million General Fund in 2019-20, and 
$4.3 million ongoing General Fund to establish new water system protocols to control Legionella bacteria and minimize the 
risk of illness at the California Health Care Facility. 
• Draw down Federal Funds for Health Care for Community Reentry Programs—The Budget includes a reduction of $4.2 
million General Fund in 2020-21 and $8.5 million ongoing related to the implementation of operational changes at reentry 
facilities that will allow the state to draw down federal funding for residents’ health care. 
• Valley State Prison Youth Offender Rehabilitative Community—The Budget includes $1.3 million General Fund in 2020-21, 
and $2 million ongoing, to establish a Youth Offender Rehabilitative Community at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla. 
• Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program Reduction—The Budget includes a one-time reduction of $30 million 
General Fund for the Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program reflecting expected challenges in full program 
implementation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
• Receiver: Information Technology Security Staffing and Tools—The Budget includes $2.9 million General Fund in 2020-21 
and $1.3 million General Fund in 2021-22 and ongoing for resources to strengthen security and cybersecurity infrastructure 
to protect inmate health records. 
• Receiver: Medical Imaging Equipment—The Budget includes $1 million General Fund in 2020-21, increasing to $2.3 million 
ongoing General Fund in 2024-25, to provide dedicated funding for replacing and maintaining X-Ray equipment. 
• Receiver: Secure Electronic Data Share Unit for Patient Health Records—The Budget includes $377,000 General Fund in 
2020-21 and $712,000 ongoing General Fund to support an electronic health care data exchange process to transfer health 
records to counties for inmates that are releasing, paroling, or being transferred to county custody. The timely sharing of 
electronic medical records will improve patient outcomes by allowing for a more seamless transition of mental health, dental,

The Department accepts commitments from California courts when the person to be committed meets age requirements, can 
materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there are adequate facilities available to care for the individual. 
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and 
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility 
operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, juvenile offender intake and court services, population management 
services, facility maintenance, and maintains juvenile offender master files. This program currently oversees operations for 
three facilities and one conservation camp. 
Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 
release planning for each offender. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based treatment 
programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption therapy, 
sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp programs, 
and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior and 
reduce recidivism and relapse. 
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the 
California Education Authority. Its mission is to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and 
knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release. 
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State 
Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education, 
English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for 
work experience. 
4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program is to provide medical, dental, and mental health care consistent 
with adopted standards for the quality and scope of services within a custodial environment. The program strives to achieve

escapee apprehension, major criminal investigations, and critical incident response training. 
4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION 
The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and 
degree of successful reintegration and release to society of offenders paroled from state prison. The program is responsible for 
providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The main components 
of supervision include Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring; the Sex Offender Management Program, which 
incorporates the containment model strategy as required by statute; and general caseload supervision utilizing the California 
Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices into the Division of Adult Parole 
Operations' supervision strategies to elicit long-term behavioral change to reduce recidivism. 
Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the offender's risk 
and current service needs. Based on case assessments, parolees may be placed in a higher-supervision category intended to 
prevent, detect, or interrupt behavior likely to endanger the community. Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification 
are regularly scheduled based on parolee behavior and stability in the community. 
The other integral program component is the Parole Planning and Placement Program, which identifies parolee needs and 
matches them with state and local programs to support a successful transition into local communities.

Services. The program includes a full continuum of transitional programs, including Integrated Services for Mentally Ill 
Parolees, the Transitional Case Management Program, and sex offender treatment for all sex offenders on parole. 
The program also provides mental health services and treatment to parolees through CDCR's Parole Outpatient Clinics. The 
objective of these services is to reduce recidivism through the stabilization and monitoring of the parolees' mental health 
issues.

4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS 
The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and 
decisions, and to provide the required due process to inmates throughout the hearing process. 
For adult offenders, the Board of Parole Hearings is responsible for setting the terms and conditions of parole and conducting 
parole consideration hearings for eligible inmates serving life sentences, including certain parole violators pursuant to Penal 
Code Section 3000.1. In January 2014, the Board began conducting youth offender parole hearings for eligible offenders 
sentenced under both the Indeterminate Sentence Law and Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to Chapter 312, Statutes of 
2013. In 2014, the Board also began conducting parole hearings for inmates eligible for elderly parole sentenced under both 
the Indeterminate Sentence Law and the Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to a federal court order. Beginning in January 
2015, the Board started evaluating certain inmates sentenced under the state's Second Strike Law for parole, pursuant to the 
same federal court order. The Board also conducts medical parole hearings and determines whether parolees should be 
discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for mentally disordered offenders and sexually violent predators, and 
subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of Mental Health. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board 
investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons and commutations of sentence, including those involving 
the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court that a prisoner's sentence be recalled due to the 
inmate's significant health condition. 
Chapter 312, Statutes of 2013 (SB 260) required the Board to establish parole suitability hearings for offenders who were under 
the age of 18 at the time they committed their controlling offense. Chapter 471, Statutes of 2015 (SB 261) extended the youth 
offender hearings to inmates who were under the age of 23 at the time of their offense. SB 261 specified that the Board 
complete a new comprehensive risk assessment for each youth offender scheduled for a parole hearing that specifically 
addresses the diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to that of adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any 
subsequent growth and increased maturity of the individual. Chapter 675, Statutes of 2017 (AB 1308) expands youth offender 
hearings to inmates who were under the age of 26 at the time of their offense. 
For juvenile offenders, the Board of Juvenile Hearings is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from 
the jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Facilities to the jurisdiction of the committing court, and disciplinary appeals. 
4580 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADMINISTRATION 
The Board of Parole Hearings - Administration program handles administrative duties in support of the Board's headquarters 
and field operations. The Administration is comprised of the Executive Team; the Administrative Services Division, which 
handles the business services functions for the Board; the Executive Analysis Unit, which develops system tools to monitor and 
track compliance; and the Legal Division, which provides legal support for the Board. 
4585 - REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS - ADULT EDUCATION 
The objective of the Rehabilitative Programs - Adult Education program is to contribute to public safety by designing and 
operating education programs that enable adult offenders to successfully reenter society. The Office of Correctional Education 
provides oversight to academic and vocational educational programs at 35 adult schools. The CDCR's schools are each 
independently accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges for the purpose of providing inmates a 
comprehensive adult education. The Office of Correctional Education develops education programs, curriculum, and policy to 
guide delivery of services to inmates. Academic and career technical programs provide inmates with an opportunity for 
improvement through basic education and career training. The Office of Correctional Education oversees Adult Basic 
Education, Adult Secondary Education, Post-Secondary Education and Career Technical Education programs. These programs

5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and 
technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal 
justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety 
Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, 
intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is 
consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based 
strategies for managing criminal justice populations. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

5420   Prison Industry Authority 
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 
in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee, 
the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker 
of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the

Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the 
Board. 
The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good 
work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA 
work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming. 
The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 
provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within 
enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work 
productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work 
programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services 
to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its 
operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.

1/ The Cost of Goods Sold and Selling and Administrative expenses shown in this display do not include year-end adjustments for Pension 
and OPEB that are required inclusions in CALPIA's audited financial statements. Excluded Pension amounts were $7,157 in FY 2017-18 
and $9,940 in FY 2018-19. Excluded OPEB amounts were $10,433 in FY 2017-18 and ($1,136) in FY 2018-19. FY 2018-19 also 
excludes year-end adjustments for Worker's Compensation and Leave Balances ($3,031 and $660 respectively). These are not costs 
incurred by CALPIA, but they rather represent a future liability earned by CALPIA employees in the respective fiscal years.
