3790   Department of Parks and Recreation 
The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and 
education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most 
valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and 
future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the 
major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural 
resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park 
visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and 
water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, 
jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds, 
plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing 
financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies. 
Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."
