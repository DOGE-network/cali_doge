PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6070 - PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD 
The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) itself is composed of five members appointed to five-year terms by the 
Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. In addition to the overall responsibility for administering the various public 
sector collective bargaining laws, the Board itself acts as an appellate body to hear challenges to proposed decisions and 
dismissals of unfair practice charges that are issued by staff. Any appeal related to the representation process is also heard by 
the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial courts. 
The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to: 
• Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively 
represent them in their labor relations with their employer. 
• Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees, 
and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws. 
• Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings. 
• Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it 
administers.

The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for managing the investigation and resolution of unfair practice charges and 
presiding over informal settlement conferences. The Office of the General Counsel also oversees the statutory process through 
which employees come to form a bargaining unit and select an organization to represent them in their labor relations with their 
employer. Additionally, this section defends PERB decisions in court, seeks appropriate injunctive relief, and obtains 
enforcement when a party does not comply with final Board decisions. 
DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW 
The Division of Administrative Law conducts adjudicative proceedings, which includes the presentation of evidence and 
examination of witnesses under oath. Proposed decisions are issued consisting of written findings of fact and legal conclusions. 
STATE MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE 
The State Mediation and Conciliation Service was established in 1947 to promote harmonious labor/management relations in 
California and became a division of PERB on July 1, 2012. The division mediates labor disputes between employers and 
employee organizations, conducts consent elections, and performs other representation-related work. In addition, the division 
provides lists of arbitrators, interpersonal workplace conflict resolution mediation, and training on a variety of collective 
bargaining processes. 
DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATION 
The Division of Administration supports operations by facilitating and managing the budget, human resources management, 
business services, procurement and contracting, fiscal accountability, information technology infrastructure, and other 
administrative needs.
