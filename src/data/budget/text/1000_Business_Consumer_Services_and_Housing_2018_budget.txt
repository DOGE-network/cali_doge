Department of Housing and Community Development
The Department of Housing and Community Development's (HCD's) mission is to preserve and expand safe and affordable
housing opportunities and promote strong communities for all Californians by (1) administering housing finance, economic
development, and community development programs, (2) developing housing policy and advocating for an adequate housing
supply, and (3) developing building codes and regulating manufactured homes and mobilehome parks. HCD also provides
technical and financial assistance to local agencies to support community development.
The California Housing Finance Agency's (CalHFA's) mission is to create and finance progressive housing solutions so more
Californians have a place to call home. CalHFA, a statutorily independent agency and component unit of state government, is
not subject to Budget Act appropriation. CalHFA is financially self-supporting, setting loan interest rates slightly above its cost
and charging fees to cover its lending costs and risks. Effective July 1, 2013, pursuant to the Governor's Reorganization Plan
No. 2 of 2012, CalHFA is displayed, for budgetary purposes only, within HCD's budget, and reports to the Business, Consumer
Services and Housing Agency.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
No Place Like Home - The Budget submits the No Place Like Home program to the voters at the November 6, 2018
statewide general election. This program dedicates up to $2 billion in bond proceeds to address homelessness for
individuals with mental health needs through the provision of permanent supportive housing. The Budget allows the voters to
validate the program’s use of Proposition 63 Mental Health Services Act funds, rather than waiting for validation through the
courts, thus expediting the expenditure of these critical homelessness funds. To enable the Department to issue awards as
soon as possible, the Budget includes a $1.2 million General Fund loan to release a notice of funding availability and review
applications in anticipation of voter approval.
•
SB 2 Homelessness Funds - The Budget includes programmatic provisions to quickly distribute the homelessness funds
available from the first year of SB 2 real estate transactions fee revenue. These provisions split available homelessness
funds between the Housing for a Healthy California program and an expanded Emergency Solutions Grant program. This
approach strikes a balance between longer-term permanent housing solutions and short-term fixes to address current
homelessness challenges at the local level.
•
Statewide Housing Package Implementation - The Budget provides $538.3 million from various funds and 81.0 positions in
2018-19, $793.9 million and 128.0 positions in 2019-20, $796.1 million and 146.0 positions in 2020-21 and 2021-22, and
$796 million and 145.0 positions in 2022-23 and ongoing to implement the recent legislative housing package. The housing
package shortens the housing development approval process, promotes local accountability to adequately plan for needed
housing, and invests in affordable housing production. Funding sources include an anticipated $4 billion voter-approved
housing bond and dedicated real estate transaction fee revenues.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
1660 - CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM
The objective of this program is to protect the public's health, safety, and general welfare in buildings and structures designed
for human occupancy through the enforcement of the California Health and Safety Code, including the State Housing Law,
Employee Housing Act, Mobilehome Parks Act, Special Occupancy Parks Act, California Factory-Built Housing Law, and the
Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act of 1980. HCD works with factory and site-built building industries, stakeholders, and
other government agencies to review and amend the international building codes as the basis for residential construction in
order to develop the California Building Standards Code. The program also enforces federal and state standards for the
construction, safety, sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars.
1665 - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The objectives of this program are to: (1) increase housing supply by providing loans and grants to develop and preserve safe
and affordable housing for lower-income households, (2) promote economic, community, and job development by awarding
state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and (4) monitor
funding recipients for compliance with the terms of their contracts with the state.
1670 - HOUSING POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The objectives of this program are to: (1) facilitate an adequate supply of housing affordable to all income groups through the
development, promotion, and implementation of innovative housing and community development policies, practices, programs,
and partnerships with state, regional, and local partners, (2) provide oversight for local housing plans, (3) administer planning
and incentive grant programs, and (4) provide research, collect and analyze data, and evaluate and communicate progress in
meeting HCD goals and outcomes.
1675 - CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY
The objective of CalHFA's lending activity is to finance housing at affordable interest rates using lending models that facilitate:
(1) mortgage loans to qualified low and moderate income homebuyers to finance the purchase of an affordable home, (2)
permanent loans to create and preserve multifamily housing projects, and (3) special needs housing loans to facilitate the
construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing needed to serve special needs populations. CalHFA also administers the
California Housing Loan Insurance Fund activity, which encourages the preservation of existing housing and improves new
housing opportunities by offering mortgage insurance products to homebuyers who might not qualify for traditional lending
programs.

policies, (2) fiduciary oversight and fiscal management through its audit, accounting, and budget functions, (3) development,
review, and implementation of legislation related to HCD programs, (4) housing-specific legal expertise, and (5) support
services in the areas of personnel, information technology, business services, and contract management.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
1700 - DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE
The Department of Real Estate ensures that individuals who wish to engage in real estate business and act in the capacity of,
or advertise as, a real estate broker or salesperson within California meet specified qualifications and ensures licensees meet
minimum education standards and requirements. The Department investigates the actions of any person acting in the capacity
of a real estate licensee, performs financial compliance audits of licensees and subdividers, administratively prosecutes
violations of the Real Estate Law and Subdivided Lands Law, and provides victims of real estate fraud with financial recovery
per limitations set by statute. The Department protects the public against fraud and misrepresentation in the sale or lease of
subdivided land through the issuance of public reports which disclose vital information to prospective purchasers of subdivision
interests.
