1111   Department of Consumer Affairs 
The Department of Consumer Affairs (Department) is responsible for promoting and protecting the interests of millions of 
California consumers by serving as a guardian and advocate for their health, safety, and economic well-being and by promoting 
legal and ethical standards of professional conduct. The Department helps promote good business practices and make sure 
California's consumers receive quality services by establishing minimal competency standards for approximately 250 
professions and occupations involving more than three million professionals. The Department is also an important advocate on 
consumer and business issues. In general, the Department's Boards and Bureaus provide exams and licensing, enforcement, 
complaint resolution, and education for consumers. 
In addition, the Department provides centralized services for efficiency. Specifically, Department staff investigate complaints 
against licensees; develop valid examinations for applicants for licensure; monitor and advocate for legislation; provide 
consumer education and outreach; provide legal and audit services; and provide general administrative support involving 
personnel, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, and space management. 
There are currently 27 boards and one commission under the broad authority of the Department, and seven bureaus and one 
certification program under the direct oversight of the Department.
