PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6280 - TAX PROGRAMS 
 
This program administers the Revenue and Taxation Code by reasonably interpreting and impartially applying the
legislatively enacted laws that provide a significant portion of General Fund revenue. The Franchise Tax Board is
responsible for administering the personal income tax and the corporation tax. Tax program activities include taxpayer
assistance and tax return processing, filing enforcement, audits, and tax collection functions. The program also includes the
collection and distribution of voluntary contributions to, and on behalf of, certain non-profit charitable organizations. 
 
6285 - POLITICAL REFORM AUDIT 
 
This program determines the accuracy and completeness of political statement reports filed with the Secretary of State, and
compliance with disclosures and record keeping requirements. On behalf of the Fair Political Practices Commission, and in
compliance with the Political Reform Act of 1974, the Franchise Tax Board conducts randomly selected field audits of
committees supporting and opposing political candidates and statewide measures, as well as any state or county central
committee or independent committee that spends $10,000 or more. 
 
6290 - DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES COLLECTIONS PROGRAM 
 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent motor vehicle license fees, taxes, and penalties on behalf of
the Department of Motor Vehicles by utilizing the same collection capabilities that are used to collect the personal income
tax. 
 
6295 - COURT COLLECTION PROGRAM 
 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent fines, penalties, and orders imposed by, and on behalf of,
superior, municipal, and justice courts by utilizing the same automated collection capabilities that are used to collect the
personal income tax. 
 
6300 - LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM 
 
This program reimburses the Department of Justice for legal services provided in the support of Franchise Tax Board
functions. 
 
6305 - CONTRACT WORK 
 
This program provides cost-effective goods and services to other governmental entities through contractual agreements.
Such goods and services include rental space to on-site childcare and cafeteria entities, data processing services for other
governmental entities, and delinquent debt collection services.

7760    Department of General Services
 
Effective July 1, 2013, the Governor's Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 2012 created the Government Operations Agency and,
as part of the plan, moved the Department of General Services (DGS) (previously budgeted within State and Consumer
Services Agency under Organization Code 1760) to this new Agency (Government Operations). 
 
As an enterprise organization, DGS provides centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-
owned and leased real estate, including design and construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural
designs for local schools and other state-owned building; printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and
equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's vehicle fleet. Furthermore, the Department of General
Services employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve California resources.
The Director of General Services serves on several state boards and commissions. 
 
Since department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the DGS' Capital Outlay Program  see "Infrastructure Overview."

7760    Department of General Services - Continued
 
The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds,
and equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties. 
 
6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES 
 
Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid
redundancy, and deliver property and facilities at the lowest possible cost.  This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate
space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Assuring protection of lives
and property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most
qualified parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to
deliver their programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for
state agencies, and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the
public's interests and ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners. 
 
6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES 
 
To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which
are basic to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include procurement of green and sustainable
materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency
support requirements include travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-
wide sustainability, energy efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and
human resources services. Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative judges to
conduct quasi-judicial hearings and mediations authorized by law. 
 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
 
The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This
program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services,
auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative
services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, labor relations, information technology,
health and safety, procurement, and contracting.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION 
 
This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and
suffer financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members,
may file a claim with the CalVCB for program benefits. 
 
6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM 
 
This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the
recovery of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice
community (the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the
consistent imposition and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities. 
 
6390 - GOVERNMENT CLAIMS 
 
This program receives, investigates, and processes claims for money or damages filed against the state. 
 
6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN 
 
This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that
benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

Government Code, Title 2, Division 5, Parts 3 and 5; and California Constitution, Article XVI, Section 17. 
 
 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
The Budget includes an increase to the state's pension contribution due to the CalPERS Board's action in 2016 to lower
the assumed rate of return for the system.  The assumption change increased the system's liabilities, resulting in an
increase to the state's funding obligation. 
 
The Budget includes a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension payment to CalPERS to mitigate the increase in state
contributions, as described above. The additional payment will be funded through a loan from the Surplus Money
Investment Fund.  The $6 billion payment will be apportioned accordingly to the five state retirement plans based on the
unfunded liability of each plan.

employer and employee contributions for prefunding retiree health care.  Pursuant to the requirements of AB 133, the $240 million 
appropriation was apportioned to the following subaccounts in 2016-17: $9,856,000 to BU2, $37,760,000 to BU5, $123,752,000 to BU6, 
$25,303,000 to BU7, $35,210,000 to BU 9, and $8,119,000 to BU10.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6410 - RETIREMENT 
 
CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits
for employees of California public employers.  CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the
line of duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2016, there were about 1,211,000 active and inactive
members, and about 649,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 
 
Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors:  age at retirement, years of service, and final
compensation.  There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace
Officer/Firefighter, California Highway Patrol, and Safety.  Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and
districts that contract with CalPERS.  However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be
limited to one of five benefit formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract
provisions. 
 
As of June 30, 2016, there were 3,021 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death,
and survivor benefits to California public employees.  CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their
careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency
retirement systems. 
 
CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 
 
6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 
 
The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee
associations, and others to provide health and long-term care insurance for state, California State University, and local
public agency employees, retirees, and their dependents.  The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts,
develops cost-effective programs, provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with
employee organizations and employer representatives. 
 
Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,
Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all
eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an
impartial intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 
 
6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 
 
Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the
purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired
members, and their beneficiaries.  Since CalPERS was established in 1932, assets have grown from $800,000 to a total of
$302 billion, as of June 30, 2016. 
 
6425 - ADMINISTRATION 
 
This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of
the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Strategy Performance,
Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Operational Support, and
Public Affairs.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
7910    Office of Administrative Law
 
The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state
regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting
these regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is
also responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that
have been recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect.  The Office assists state regulatory
agencies through a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with
the Administrative Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state
agencies and members of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 
 
In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies
constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 
 
The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and
the California Regulatory Notice Register.

7920    State Teachers' Retirement System
 
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution
plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred
compensation plans and programs: 
 
State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP)
CalSTRS Pension2 Program (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans)
Teachers' Health Benefits Fund
Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund
 
CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public
school teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system.
As of June 30, 2016, there are approximately 914,000 members, retirees and beneficiaries of the STRP Defined Benefit
Program. 
 
CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers'
Retirement Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
The Budget includes a 0.50 percent increase to the state's contribution to reflect changes in demographic and economic
assumption changes adopted by the CalSTRS Board in 2017.  The assumption changes increased the system's liabilities,
resulting in an increase to the state's funding obligation.

6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS 
 
CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for
the distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program,
the largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic
retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.  The
member may modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their
beneficiary after the member dies.  Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date
of the member's retirement.  A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by
statute and/or contract provisions. 
 
Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the
General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System).  The
cost of administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
