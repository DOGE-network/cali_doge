Education 
Education programs provide academic services 
segmented by pre-kindergarten, elementary, 
secondary, undergraduate and graduate programs 
as well as credentialing services to ensure 
schools are staffed with effective instructors. 
Elementary and secondary instruction is provided 
to all of California's children to prepare them for 
higher education or entry into the workforce. 
Institutions of higher education provide further 
access to the skills necessary for career goals and 
participation in a globally competitive workforce, 
as well as conducting research and providing 
public services. 
6100   Department of Education 
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million 
students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Systems Support Branch; the Teaching 
and Learning Support Branch; the Performance, Planning, and Technology Branch; and the Legal and Audits Branch. 
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to 
work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding 
local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to 
enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and 
supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that 
promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the 
administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing 
broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering 
systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help 
students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that 
promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the Department. 
Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

The State Special Schools Division has six facilities under its jurisdiction: three residential schools and three diagnostic centers. 
These facilities comprise a total of approximately 1,042,000 gross square feet on 167.29 acres. 
The residential schools serve students ranging in age from 3 to 22. They include Schools for the Deaf in Riverside and Fremont 
and a School for the Blind in Fremont. The California Schools for the Deaf provide comprehensive educational programs

residential campus that provides intensive, disability-specific educational services for pupils who are blind, visually impaired, or 
deaf-blind. The diagnostic centers are regionally located in Fresno, Fremont, and Los Angeles; the centers address the unique 
educational needs of California's most difficult to serve special education students.

6125   Education Audit Appeals Panel 
The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals by 
K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of 
substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory

6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System 
The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). 
The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members' 
creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an 
additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on 
July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three 
years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase 
the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 
The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in 
quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing 
power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection 
payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to 
set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to 
CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an 
amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding 
calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15 
of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’ 
Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) 
increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

Education Code, Title 1, Division 1, Part 13, Chapter 16. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $3.3 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The roughly $241 million increase from 
the previous fiscal year is due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its authority to 
increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law in 2014. 
• In addition to the state’s statutorily-required annual contribution, the Budget includes a $1.1 billion supplemental pension 
payment towards the state’s share of the unfunded liability for the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program. This amount is the first 
installment payment out of an estimated $2.9 billion to be paid to CalSTRS through 2022-23 using available Proposition 2 
debt payment funding. 
• Additionally, the Budget includes $2.25 billion General Fund in 2018-19 to be paid to CalSTRS on behalf of school 
employers. Of this amount, roughly $606 million will supplant school employer contributions to CalSTRS over the next two 
fiscal years, reducing the contribution rate by 1.03 percent in 2019-20 and by 0.70 percent in 2020-21. The remaining $1.64 
billion will be paid towards the school employers’ share of the unfunded liability for the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program.

6350   School Facilities Aid Program 
The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities 
such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.  This program is administered by the State Allocation 
Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 
The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility 
Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in 
statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.  These funds primarily 
support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through 
the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding 
relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7) 
seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general 
obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 
billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical 
education projects. 
The 2018 and 2019 Budget Acts provided one-time General Fund to support the Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant 
Program to help school districts address the facility costs associated with providing full-day kindergarten programs.  The Full-
Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program is also administered by the State Allocation Board.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure 
a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 290,000 applications annually for 
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the 
primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential 
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 
The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas, 
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including 
the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and 
development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the 
Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to 
monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of 
program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program 
approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated 
assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal 
advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of 
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and 
applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct 
disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions. 
5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES 
Provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in credential 
holder discipline cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process. 
5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT 
The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher 
preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface. 
5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS 
This program is intended to update the California Teaching Performance Assessment to the Common Core State Standards 
and Next Generation Science Standards as well as to develop an Administrator Performance Assessment and a Teacher 
Performance Assessment for candidates seeking a credential in special education.  In addition to ensuring that credential 
candidates are prepared to enter the teaching profession, candidate scores from these assessments will be included in the 
accreditation system for program quality assessment.

6440   University of California 
The University of California (UC) provides higher education through (1) instruction in undergraduate, graduate, and 
professional degree programs and postdoctoral programs; (2) research; (3) education for professional careers; and (4) public 
service. 
The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 
1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the 
following 26 members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 
12-year terms, and 1 student appointed by the Board.  The Governor is President of the Regents. 
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates the UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for 
research. In addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment 
primarily responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 
There are ten UC campuses as follows: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, 
Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses and offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional 
education. The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching 
hospitals in the counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and Orange. The university administers more 
than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. The university provides oversight of one United States 
Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories. 
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource 
allocation. The 10 chancellors are responsible for management of individual campuses. The Regents have delegated authority 
to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

groups of students meet the standards of academic preparation needed to be successful in higher education and the 
workforce. The program also includes UC Cooperative Extension, which provides applied research and educational programs 
in agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer sciences, and community resource development. Campuses also

exhibits; support of specialized physical science and engineering projects; and support for professional journals. 
TEACHING HOSPITALS 
This program includes the operation of five academic medical centers in Irvine, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, and San

health professional schools. The medical centers provide inpatient and outpatient health care services and are research sites 
for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.

including their intellectual, cultural and social development outside the context of the formal instructional program and health 
services.

campus provisions and (2) from campus provisions to operating programs and subprograms from which expenditures will 
occur.  The program may include funds for academic position upgrades, staff reclassifications, price adjustments, employee 
benefit adjustments, debt service, and university endowment income. 
EXTRAMURAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes activities supported by fund sources defined as non-budgeted due to the limited life of the funding 
source.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5530 - This program provides support for Hastings. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 
INSTRUCTION 
Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal 
profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 
The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal 
profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students 
with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism 
for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in 
overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 
The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference 
and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom 
presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law 
library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
Student services include admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support 
Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices provide 
students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist 
students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment 
opportunities. These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support 
Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other 
services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety, 
community relations, and administrative services. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and 
administration of maintenance and renovation activities for the college's plant. 
EXTRAMURAL 
Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. These 
include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

6610   California State University 
The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate 
instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal education programs. For undergraduate programs, each campus 
requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to master's-level 
graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and audiology. The 
CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 
The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16 
members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student 
representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year 
term by the CSU Alumni Council. The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the 
Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty 
representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 
The CSU’s goals include: 
• Offering degree programs in academic and applied areas that are responsive to the needs of citizens of this state and 
providing for regular review of the nature and extent of these programs. 
• Providing public services to the people of California. 
• Providing services to students enrolled in the university. 
• Offering instruction at the doctoral level jointly with the University of California and with private institutions of postsecondary 
education, or independently in the fields of education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and audiology.

outside the context of the formal instruction program. This category includes expenses for student activities, cultural events, 
student newspapers, intramural athletics, student organizations, intercollegiate athletics, counseling and career guidance, 
student aid administration, and enrollment management and student health service offices. 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
An auxiliary enterprise exists to furnish goods or services to students, faculty, or staff, other institutional departments, or 
incidentally to the general public, and charges a fee directly related to the cost of the goods or services. The distinguishing 
characteristic of an auxiliary enterprise is that it is managed as an essentially self-supporting activity. Examples are residence 
halls, food services, intercollegiate athletics (only if essentially self-supporting), college stores, faculty clubs, parking, and 
faculty housing.

6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants 
This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their 
dependents. 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health 
plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 
The 2018-19 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established 
in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members 
hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest 
health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also 
contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2018 monthly contribution 
maximums are $725 for a single enrollee, $1,377 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,766 for an enrollee and two or 
more dependents. The 2019 monthly contribution maximums are $734 for a single enrollee, $1,398 for an enrollee and one 
dependent, and $1,788 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges 
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 
California's 73 community college districts, which operate 115 community colleges. The Board has 17 members appointed by 
the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student 
members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms. 
The objectives of the Board are to: 
• Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 
• Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 
• Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 
related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see 
"Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5755 - FINANCIAL AID GRANTS PROGRAM 
This program provides grants and other kinds of financial aid to help undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at eligible 
institutions pay for educational expenses.  The financial aid programs are described below. 
CAL GRANT PROGRAM 
Cal Grant entitlement awards are guaranteed to students who graduate from high school and meet financial, academic, and 
other general program eligibility requirements.  The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are guaranteed 
to certain community college students who have a community college grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.4 on a four-point 
scale. 
Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility 
requirements.  Half of these awards are offered to those applicants who did not receive an entitlement award and meet a March 
2 deadline.  The remaining awards are offered to students who are enrolled at a California community college and meet a 
September 2 deadline. 
Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 GPA on 
a four-point scale. 
Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point scale. 
The award is for books and living expenses for the first year.  Beginning with the second year, the award also provides funds for 
tuition and fees. 
The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the 
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU).  The annual Budget Act sets the award amount 
for recipients attending private nonprofit or private, for-profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of 
Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the award for recipients attending private, for-profit institutions that are not WASC-
accredited. 
The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training. 
The Cal Grant Students with Dependent Children Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for students 
with dependent children attending the UC, CSU, or a California Community College. 
The Cal Grant B Service Incentive Grant Program provides grants to undocumented Cal Grant B recipients who are exempt 
from paying nonresident tuition and complete community or volunteer service at a qualifying organization. 
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 
The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students of no more than 40 percent of 
the UC or CSU mandatory systemwide tuition and fees. 
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS 
The California Chafee Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 to eligible foster youth who are enrolled in college or 
vocational school at least half-time.  New and renewal awards are made based on available funding. 
The California Military Department GI Bill Award Program provides funding for active members of the California National Guard, 
the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia who seek a certificate, degree, or diploma.  Recipients attending the UC, CSU or 
a private institution may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant A award.  Recipients attending a community college may 
receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant B award.  An award used for graduate studies may not exceed the maximum amount 
of a Cal Grant A award plus $500 for books and supplies. 
The Child Development Teacher and Supervisor Grant Program provided grants to recipients who intend to teach or supervise 
in the field of child care and development in a licensed children's center.  Recipients attending a community college received up 
to $1,000 annually, and recipients attending a four-year college received up to $2,000 annually for a total of $6,000. 
The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents (LEPD) Scholarship Program provides college grants equivalent to Cal Grant 
amounts to dependents of California law enforcement officers, officers and employees of the Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation, and firefighters killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Golden State Teacher Grant Program provides one-time grants of $20,000 to students enrolled in a teacher preparation 
program who commit to teaching in high-need fields at a qualifying school. 
LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAMS 
The Assumption Program of Loans for Education (APLE) issues agreements for loan assumptions to students and district 
interns who are pursuing careers in teaching and credentialed teachers teaching at certain schools.  A participant who teaches 
a total of four years can receive up to $11,000 for outstanding student loans.  APLE participants who teach in the areas of 
math, science, or education specialist instruction in a school ranked in the lowest 60 percentile of the API may receive an 
additional $1,000 per year in loan assumption benefits.  Participants meeting this requirement who provide teaching service in 
a public school ranked in the lowest 20 percentile of the API may receive an additional $1,000 per year.  The total possible loan 
assumption benefit is $19,000. 
The State Nursing Assumption Program of Loans for Education for Nursing Faculty (SNAPLE NF) allows the state to issue 
agreements for loan assumption to persons who have completed at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing or a field related to 
nursing and agreed to teach at one or more regionally-accredited, eligible California colleges or universities.  A participant can 
receive up to $8,333 annually for three years toward outstanding student loans for a total loan assumption of up to $25,000. 
The John R. Justice Program provides loan repayments to eligible recipients currently employed as California prosecutors or 
public defenders who commit to continued employment in that capacity for at least three years.  Recipients may receive up to 
$5,000 of loan repayment disbursed annually to their lending institutions. 
OUTREACH PROGRAMS 
The California Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal-SOAP), through intersegmental consortia, provides financial aid 
outreach and tutoring services to disadvantaged K-12 students, increases their access to postsecondary education, and 
informs students about opportunities for career technical education.  Cal-SOAP also assists the matriculation of community 
college students to four-year institutions. 
Cash for College provides financial aid workshops to assist low-income students with completing the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid and the Cal Grant GPA Verification Form and understanding financial aid. 
5775 - CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRANT PROGRAM 
The Child Savings Account Grant Program provides grants to support local governments and nonprofit organizations that 
sponsor or create local or regional child savings account programs.
