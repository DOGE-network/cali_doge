Education 
Education programs provide academic services 
segmented by pre-kindergarten, elementary, 
secondary, undergraduate and graduate programs 
as well as credentialing services to ensure 
schools are staffed with effective instructors. 
Elementary and secondary instruction is provided 
to all of California's children to prepare them for 
higher education or entry into the workforce. 
Institutions of higher education provide further 
access to the skills necessary for career goals and 
participation in a globally competitive workforce, 
as well as conducting research and providing 
public services. 
6100   Department of Education 
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6 million 
students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Operations and Administration Branch; 
the Opportunities for All Branch; the Information and Technology Branch; the Instruction, Measurement and Administration 
Branch; the Strategy, Policy & Special Projects Branch; and the Legal, Audits and Charters Branch. 
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to administer TK-12 education programs, to provide technical 
assistance to local school districts and offices of education and to work with the educational community to improve academic 
performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding local agencies accountable for student achievement in all 
programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity in utilizing a process of continual improvement that enables 
all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and supporting 
teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that promotes 
effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of 
TK-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing broader and more 
effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering systems of school, 
home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help students succeed, (h) 
advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that promotes good business 
practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Department. 
Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

Early Education and Expanded Learning: 
Provides a full range of universal prekindergarten early education and development services, including part- and full-time early 
education, development, and supportive services to children from low-income families, children with disabilities, and children 
experiencing homelessness or receiving child protective services. The California State Preschool Program provides a wide 
range of educational services in part and full-day settings for pre-kindergarten (two, three and four-year-old) children from low-
income families, children with disabilities, children who are multilingual learners, and children experiencing homelessness or 
receiving protective services, and parent education for the parents of eligible children. The After School Education and Safety 
(ASES) competitive grant program provides students in grades K-9 with academic support, homework assistance, and 
enrichment programs, in a safe after school environment. The Expanded Learning Opportunities Program provides support for 
before, after, and summer school programs for TK-6 grade students. The 21st Century Community Learning Center Program 
also provides the same supports for K-12 students. 
Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership: 
Provides federal funding and enhanced whole child developmental and health supports for high-quality infant and toddler early 
learning and care to low-income families enrolled in subsidized programs administered by family childcare homes, school

nutrition program sponsors that serve nutritious meals to children participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), 
School Breakfast Program, Special Milk Program, Summer Food Service Program, After School Meals Supplements Program 
under the NSLP, and Seamless Summer Feeding Option. Collectively, over 885 million meals and snacks were served across

6125   Education Audit Appeals Panel 
The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals by 
K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of 
substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory 
timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits, including Local School Construction Bond Audits, School Facility 
Program Bond Fund Audits, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program Audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear 
standards for compliance with education funding requirements, and allow both the state and local educational agencies to 
avoid lengthy and expensive litigation over disputed funding.

6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System 
The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). 
The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members' 
creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an 
additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on 
July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three 
years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can adjust the 
state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 
The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in 
quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing 
power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection 
payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to 
set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to 
CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an 
amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding 
calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15 
of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’ 
Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) 
increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

6350   School Facilities Aid Program 
The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities 
such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.  The programs are administered by the State Allocation 
Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 
The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility 
Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved $51.0 billion in 
statewide general obligation bonds, and the State Budget Acts of 2021-22 through 2023-24 provided more than $3.5 billion in 
General Fund proceeds, to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.  These funds primarily support the 
construction and modernization of school facilities; however, voters have supported funding other programs through the SFP 
including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding relief 
projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7) seismic 
mitigation grants. 
Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2024, authorizes a total of $8.5 billion in state general obligation bonds for 
school construction projects. These funds are allocated amongst various existing programs including $3.3 billion for new 
construction, $4 billion for modernization, $600 million for charter schools, and $600 million for career technical education 
projects. Proposition 2 also authorizes funding through the new construction and/or modernization programs for the 
replacement of school buildings that are at least 75 years old, assistance to small school districts and school facilities located 
on military installations, inclusion of energy efficient project components, and the construction or retrofit of minimum essential 
facilities and transitional kindergarten classrooms. Additionally, Proposition 2 establishes new options for the State Allocation

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure 
a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 280,000 applications annually for 
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the 
primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential 
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 
The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas, 
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including 
the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and 
development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the 
Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to 
monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of 
program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program 
approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated 
assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal 
advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of 
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and

applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct 
disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions. 
5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES 
This program provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission in credential holder discipline 
cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process. 
5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT 
The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher 
preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface. 
5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS 
This program supports development and implementation of Performance Assessments for credential candidates in preparation 
programs that lead to a teaching or administrative services credential.  In addition to ensuring that credential candidates are 
prepared to enter the teaching profession or serve as a school administrator, candidate scores from these assessments will be 
included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment. 
5388 - CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING GRANT PROGRAM 
This program provides grants to K-12 local educational agencies to support recruitment of non-certificated school employees to 
participate in a teacher preparation program and become certificated classroom teachers in California public schools. 
5397 - EDUCATOR PREPARATION 
Provides funding for competitive grants to local educational agencies to recruit, prepare, and retain credentialed K-12 
educators. 
5399 - ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and internal 
administrative support services.

6440   University of California 
The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic 
programs through the doctoral degree level; research; continuing education for adult learners; and public service. 
The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 
1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the UC. The Board of Regents includes the following 26 members: 
7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms, and 1 student 
appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents. 
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. The 
UC also serves students at all levels of higher education in California and serves as the public segment primarily responsible 
for awarding doctoral degrees and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 
There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa 
Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education. 
The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and 
administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States 
Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories. 
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource 
allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated 
authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

entering fall 2022 and later, the three charges will be assessed on a cohort basis. For graduate students, the three charges will continue to be assessed on a uniform basis. The 2023-24, 2024-25 and 2025-26 amounts 
for undergraduate students, as shown in the display, reflect student fee levels for the cohort entering fall 2023, fall 2024 and fall 2025, respectively.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5440 - This program provides support for the university. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 
INSTRUCTION 
General Campuses 
This program includes direct instructional resources associated with the schools and colleges located on the general 
campuses. Classroom and laboratory instruction, instructional technology, online education, and joint scholarly research 
activities of students and faculty are included. 
Health Sciences 
This program includes instruction in 21 schools that provide education in various health fields to students preparing for careers 
in health care, teaching, and research. The health science schools are located on seven campuses and include six schools of 
medicine (Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego and San Francisco), two schools of dentistry, four schools of 
nursing, four schools of public health, three schools of pharmacy, one school of veterinary medicine, and one school of 
optometry. In addition, programs in medical education are conducted at Berkeley, Fresno, and the Charles R. Drew University 
of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles. 
Summer Session 
This program includes instruction for non-matriculated students who enroll in summer sessions. 
University Extension 
This program includes classes, hybrid instructional programs, short courses, seminars, conferences, field studies, online 
education, and similar activities throughout the state and in several foreign countries. University Extension has open enrollment 
courses for individuals as well as organizational partnerships supported by contracts and grants with the state and public 
agencies, non-profit organizations, and private companies. University Extension's offerings are often designed to serve the 
continuing educational needs of working professionals. University Extension offers undergraduate and graduate transferable 
degree credit and certificate and degree completion programs. 
RESEARCH 
This program includes research activities. The university is designated by the 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education as the 
primary state-supported academic agency for research. 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
This program includes a broad range of activities organized by the university to serve students, teachers, and staff in K-12 
schools and community colleges, as well as the public in general. The program includes student academic preparation 
programs and educational partnerships. In these programs, the university works with schools and other partners to help certain 
groups of students meet the standards of academic preparation needed to be successful in higher education and the 
workforce. The program also includes UC Cooperative Extension, which provides applied research and educational programs 
in agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer sciences, and community resource development. Campuses also 
conduct other public service programs, such as arts and lecture programs and student-initiated community service projects. 
This program also includes a health sciences program jointly operated with the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and 
Science. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT 
Libraries 
The library program facilitates scholarship, research, and developments based on the utilization and sharing of knowledge, 
publications and scholarly materials in all formats. The library system provides support for programs of teaching and research 
and serves the needs of students, faculty and staff; and provides interinstitutional support for academic programs in other 
institutions of higher learning in California, both public and private. 
Academic Support 
This program includes activities organized and operated in connection with educational departments and conducted as a basic 
support for the departments' educational programs. 
The program includes facilities that are extensions of the health sciences schools and provide both clinical experience and 
community health services, including dental clinics and neuropsychiatric institutes at Los Angeles and San Francisco; a 
veterinary medicine teaching facility at Davis and the San Joaquin Valley; an optometry clinic at Berkeley; and two occupational 
health centers providing services throughout northern (Berkeley, Davis, and San Francisco) and southern (Irvine and Los 
Angeles) California.

professional development in the field of education. 
TEACHING HOSPITALS 
This program includes the operation of teaching hospitals in Irvine, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, and San Francisco. 
A critical mission of the hospitals is to support the clinical teaching programs of the University's 20 health professional schools. 
The hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient health care services and are research sites for the development of new 
diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
This program includes activities that contribute to students' emotional and physical well-being, including their intellectual, 
cultural and social development outside the context of the formal instructional program. Elements of these programs are 
supplementary educational services, social and cultural activities, counseling and psychological services, career guidance, 
student health services, co-curricular support, disability services; student admissions and records, and financial aid 
administration.

charges or fees. Certain activities are both student services and auxiliary enterprises, such as student housing, campus stores, 
food services, campus stores, parking, and portions of some intercollegiate athletics. 
PROVISIONS FOR ALLOCATION 
This program is a temporary repository for lump-sum appropriations that are allocated: (1) from systemwide provisions to 
campus provisions and (2) from campus provisions to operating programs and subprograms from which expenditures will 
occur. The program may include funds for academic position upgrades, staff reclassifications, price adjustments, employee 
benefit adjustments, debt service, and university endowment income. 
EXTRAMURAL PROGRAMS

6445   California Institute for Regenerative Medicine 
The mission of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) is to accelerate world class science to deliver 
transformative regenerative medicine treatments to a diverse California and worldwide in an equitable manner. The Institute 
was established pursuant to the November 2004 voter-approved Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures 
Act, providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for grants and loans for stem cell research conducted at California 
universities, research institutions, and companies. In November 2020, voters approved Proposition 14, the Stem Cell Research 
Institute Bond Initiative, authorizing $5.5 billion in new general obligation bonds to continue regenerative medicine research. 
Proposition 14 also requires that revenues generated through licensing or self-commercializing an invention or technology that 
arises from research funded by CIRM be used to offset the costs of providing treatments and cures arising from CIRM-funded 
research to California patients who have insufficient means to purchase such treatment or cure, including the reimbursement of 
patient-qualified costs for research participants. 
The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 35-member governing board for the Institute. The members are public 
officials appointed on the basis of their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and research 
institutions, patient advocacy groups, and the life sciences biotechnology industry.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5530 - This program provides support for CLSF. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 
INSTRUCTION 
Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal 
profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 
The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal 
profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students 
with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism 
for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in 
overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 
The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference 
and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom 
presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law 
library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
Student services include admissions, office of the registrar, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic 
Support Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices 
provide students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and 
assist students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment 
opportunities. These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support 
Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other 
services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety, 
community relations, and administrative services. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and 
administration of maintenance and renovation activities for the college's plant. 
EXTRAMURAL 
Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. These 
include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

6610   California State University 
The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 universities. All universities offer undergraduate and graduate 
instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal arts education programs. For undergraduate programs, each 
university requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to 
master's-level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in audiology, education, nursing practice, 
occupational therapy, physical therapy, and public health. The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University 
of California and with private institutions. 
The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16 
members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student 
representatives and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year term by the CSU Alumni 
Council. The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the university presidents. The Trustees, the Chancellor, and the presidents 
develop systemwide policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the 
universities, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 
The mission of the CSU is to: 
• Advance and extend knowledge, learning, and culture, especially throughout California. 
• Provide opportunities for individuals to develop intellectually, personally, and professionally. 
• Prepare significant numbers of educated, responsible people to contribute to California’s schools, economy, culture, and 
future.  
• Encourage and provide access to an excellent education to all who are prepared for and wish to participate in collegiate 
study. 
• Offer undergraduate and graduate instruction leading to bachelor’s and higher degrees in the liberal arts and sciences, 
applied fields, and the professions, including the doctoral degree when authorized. 
• Prepare students for international, multi-cultural society. 
• Provide public services that enrich the university and its communities.

activities include expenses for credit and noncredit courses; academic, vocational, and technical instruction; remedial and 
tutorial instruction; and regular, special, and extension sessions. 
RESEARCH 
The research category includes all expenses for activities specifically organized to produce research, whether commissioned 
by an agency external to the institution or separately budgeted by an organizational unit within the institution. These activities 
include expenses for individual and/or project research as well as that of institutes and research centers. 
PUBLIC SERVICES 
The public service category includes expenses for activities established primarily to provide non-instructional services 
beneficial to individuals and groups external to the institution. These activities include community service programs (excluding 
instructional activities) and cooperative extension services. Included in this category are conferences, institutes, general 
advisory services, reference bureaus, radio and television, consulting, and similar non-instructional services to particular 
sectors of the community. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT 
The academic support category includes expenses to provide support services to the institution’s primary missions: instruction, 
research, and public service. This category includes the retention, preservation, and display of educational materials, including 
libraries, museums, and galleries; the provision of services that directly assist the academic functions of the institution, such as 
demonstration schools associated with a department, school, or college of education; media such as audio-visual services and 
technology such as computing support; academic administration and personnel development providing administration support 
and management direction to the three primary missions; and separately budgeted support for course and curriculum 
development. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
The student services category includes expenses incurred for offices of admissions and the registrar and activities with the 
primary purpose of contributing to students' emotional and physical well-being and intellectual, cultural, and social development 
outside the context of the formal instruction program. This category includes expenses for student activities, cultural events, 
student newspapers, intramural athletics, student organizations, intercollegiate athletics, counseling and career guidance, 
student aid administration, and enrollment management and student health service offices. 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
The institutional support category includes expenses for central executive-level activities concerned with management and 
long-range planning for the entire institution, such as the governing board, planning and programming operations, and legal 
services; fiscal operations, including the investment office; administrative data processing; space management; employee 
personnel and records; logistical activities that provide procurement, storerooms, and printing; transportation services to the 
institution; support services to faculty and staff; and activities concerned with community and alumni relations, including 
development and fundraising. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
The operation and maintenance of plant category includes all expenses for the administration, supervision, operation, 
maintenance, preservation and protection of the institution's physical plant. This category includes expenses normally incurred 
for items such as janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture, and equipment; 
care of grounds; maintenance and operations of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster 
preparedness; safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to property; space and 
capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. 
STUDENT FINANCIAL AID 
Student financial aid includes institutional aid (State University Grants), tuition and fee waivers, scholarships, and fellowships 
from restricted or unrestricted funds. The category also includes trainee stipends, prizes, and awards. 
AUXILIARY ENTERPRISES 
An auxiliary enterprise exists to furnish goods or services to students, faculty, or staff, other institutional departments, or 
incidentally to the general public, and charges a fee directly related to the cost of the goods or services. The distinguishing 
characteristic of an auxiliary enterprise is that it is managed as an essentially self-supporting activity. Examples are residence

6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants 
This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their 
dependents. 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan. 
Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 
The 2024-25 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established 
in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members 
hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest 
health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also 
contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2024 monthly contribution 
maximums are $983 for a single enrollee, $1,890 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $2,366 for an enrollee and two or 
more dependents. The 2025 monthly contribution maximums are $1,060 for a single enrollee, $2,039 for an enrollee and one 
dependent, and $2,551 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges 
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 
California's 73 community college districts, which operate 116 community colleges. The Board has 18 voting members as 
specified in statute. Twelve members are appointed by the Governor, require Senate approval for six-year terms, and must 
include two current or former local board members. Five members are appointed by the Governor to two-year terms and 
include two students, two faculty members, and one classified member. The Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of 
the Board. 
The objectives of the Board are to: 
• Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 
• Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 
• Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 
related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see 
"Infrastructure Overview."

other general program eligibility requirements.  The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are guaranteed 
to certain community college students who have a community college grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.4 on a four-point 
scale. 
Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility 
requirements.  These awards are offered to applicants who do not receive an entitlement award. 
Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 GPA on 
a four-point scale. 
Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point scale. 
The award is for books and living expenses for the first year.  Beginning with the second year, the award also provides funds for 
tuition and fees. 
The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the 
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU).  The annual Budget Act sets the award amount 
for recipients attending private nonprofit or private, for-profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of 
Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the award for recipients attending private, for-profit institutions that are not WASC-
accredited. 
The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training. 
The Cal Grant Students with Dependent Children Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for students 
with dependent children attending the UC, CSU, a California Community College, or eligible private nonprofit institution. 
The Cal Grant Foster Youth Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for current and former foster 
youth attending the UC, CSU, a California Community College, or an eligible private institution. 
The California Dream Act Service Incentive Grant Program provides grants to eligible Cal Grant recipients who apply for aid 
through the California Dream Act Application and complete community or volunteer service at a qualifying organization. 
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 
The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students. The maximum award amount 
for each student is determined by specific criteria and subject to funding provided in the annual Budget Act. 
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS 
The California Chafee Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 to eligible foster youth who are enrolled in college or 
vocational school at least half-time.  New and renewal awards are made based on available funding. 
The California Military Department GI Bill Award Program provides funding for active members of the California National Guard, 
the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia who seek a certificate, degree, or diploma.  Recipients attending the UC, CSU or 
a private institution may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant A award.  Recipients attending a community college may 
receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant B award.  An award used for graduate studies may not exceed the maximum amount 
of a Cal Grant A award plus $500 for books and supplies. 
 
The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents (LEPD) Scholarship Program provides college grants equivalent to Cal Grant 
amounts to dependents of California law enforcement officers, officers and employees of the Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation, and firefighters killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. 
The Golden State Teacher Grant Program provides one-time grants of up to $10,000 for the 2024-25 academic year 
(depending on the institution where enrolled ) to students enrolled in a teacher preparation or pupil personnel services 
credential program who commit to teaching at a qualifying school or preschool. 
The Learning Aligned Employment Program provides one-time grants to participating public postsecondary education 
institutions for the purposes of offering eligible students with the opportunity to earn money to help defray their educational 
costs, while gaining valuable education-aligned, career-related experience.
