INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
The California High-Speed Rail Authority is currently headquartered in Sacramento, with regional offices in San Jose, Fresno
and Los Angeles. Planning is currently underway for the entire high-speed train system, which consists of Phase 1 (San

design-build contracts and continues to acquire real property and right-of-way accesses for the first construction section of the
high-speed rail system, extending 119 miles from Madera to just north of Bakersfield.

Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and
Suisun
The Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun is the oversight body that licenses
and regulates maritime pilots who navigate certain large vessels entering or leaving those bays, Monterey Bay, and on
tributaries to Sacramento and Stockton.
The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident
investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and
providing pilotage fee rate recommendations to the Legislature. The seven members of the Board are appointed by the
Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio member. The Board
was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850.
All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by
the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost
of Board operations, and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Three separate surcharges are based upon ship movements
and fund a pilot continuing education program, a pilot trainee training program, and the acquisition of navigation technology for
use by pilots. Two separate surcharges are based upon the tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay
and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
2050 - TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
The objectives of this program are to minimize deaths, injuries, and property losses due to traffic accidents; to reduce traffic
delays to the motoring public; to provide protection and assistance to the motoring public, state employees and property,
including protection of the State Capitol and the surrounding grounds, state constitutional officers, and visiting dignitaries; and
to curtail the potential for terrorist threats as part of broader state and federal homeland security efforts. These objectives are
achieved through both ground and flight operations.
2055 - REGULATION AND INSPECTION
The CHP operates 55 commercial vehicle enforcement facilities statewide with the objectives of:
•
Reducing the incidence of truck and bus accidents attributable to defective vehicle equipment, improper maintenance,
loading or securing of cargo, or disqualified drivers.
•
Protecting the public from spills of hazardous materials or specially regulated loads, and from the improper operation of
specified vehicles such as ambulances and armored cars.
•
Protecting farm workers transported in farm labor vehicles and children transported in school buses.
•
Ensuring that proper registration fees are paid, and protecting highways from excessive vehicle weights.
2060 - VEHICLE OWNERSHIP SECURITY
This program protects the public from vehicle theft through:
•
Investigation and prosecution of the professional vehicle thief.
•
Assistance and training of CHP and allied agency personnel.
•

The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) promotes driver safety by licensing drivers and protects consumers by issuing
vehicle titles and regulating vehicle sales.
Because DMV's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, DMV has a capital outlay program to support this need.
