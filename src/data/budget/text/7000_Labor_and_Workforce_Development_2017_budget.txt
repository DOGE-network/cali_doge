Labor and
Workforce
Development
The Labor and Workforce Development Agency
was established to address issues relating to
California workers and their employers. The
Agency is responsible for labor law enforcement,
workforce development, and benefit payment
and adjudication. The Agency works to combat
the underground economy and help legitimate
businesses and workers in California through a
combination of enforcement and education
activities.
 
7100    Employment Development Department
 
The Employment Development Department (EDD) enhances California's economic growth and prosperity by collaboratively
delivering valuable and innovative services to meet the evolving needs of employers, workers, and job seekers. The EDD
connects employers with job seekers, administers the Unemployment Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Paid Family
Leave programs, and provides employment and training programs under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act. Additionally, the EDD collects various employment payroll taxes including the personal income tax, and collects and
provides comprehensive economic, occupational, and socio-demographic labor market information concerning California's
workforce. 
 
Because the EDD's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
5900 - EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT RELATED SERVICES  
 
The objective of the Employment and Employment Related Services Program is to provide a variety of services to facilitate a
match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an Internet labor exchange system to
facilitate this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are
designed to provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees,
veterans, youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience
Unlimited locations designed for executive, technical, and professional job seekers to assist each other in finding suitable
employment. 
 
5915 - CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD 
 
The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board is a quasi-judicial agency whose primary purpose is to conduct
impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax
liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one

The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition,
the Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various
benefit programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction. 
 
5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM 
 
The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California
workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term
income replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own. 
 
5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM 
 
The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing
monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who
take time off from work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling,
parent-in-law or to bond with a new minor child. 
 
5930 - TAX PROGRAM 
 
The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax
collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to
support the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs. 
 
5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL 
 
The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including
small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable
wages and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business
retention and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local
partners, prioritizes special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-
paying jobs throughout the state. 
 
5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT 
 
The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce
Investment Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities
through statewide and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of
California in local communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants
to the workforce, veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-
related information to job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the
employment, job retention, earnings, and occupational skills of participants. 
 
5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS 
 
The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as National Emergency Grant Program,
consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers
due to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the
state to react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS 
 
This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group
of employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is
actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees.  The program also ensures that each self-insured
private-sector employer posts a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the
employer defaults on its obligations. 
 
6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
 
The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize
disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides
administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation
benefits.  The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators to ensure compliance with the benefit
delivery system required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers
from the Uninsured Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund.  The Division promotes

the practice of early and sustained return to work of injured employees.  The Division also administers a workers'
compensation information system designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency
of the benefit delivery system. 
 
The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers'
compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the
court, and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process. 
 
6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
 
The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for: (1) issuing an annual report on the
state of the workers' compensation system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications which
would improve the operation of the system; (2) conducting specified surveys and evaluations required by law; (3) conducting
continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and
occupational diseases, including making recommendations on how to improve the workers' compensation and health and
safety program, and if it deems appropriate, conducting or contracting for studies necessary to carry out its responsibilities;
(4) maintaining the occupational safety and health training and education program and funding an insurance loss control
services coordinator; and (5) issuing, if necessary, a report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of
the notices required to be provided by insurers and self-insured employers. 
 
6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 
 
The objectives of this program include the promotion and enforcement of measures to protect the health and safety of
workers on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels
for the benefit of the general public.  These objectives are accomplished by the coordinated efforts of the Division of
Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the
Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (Cal/OSHA Appeals Board). 
 
DOSH enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries, and
helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions.  DOSH conducts inspections of, and issues permits to
operate, elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels.  The
inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these
devices.  Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, DOSH also obtains and maintains job safety
records, reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and
provides accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made
by state and local government. 
 
The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as
follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of
labor, one member from the field of occupational health, and one member from the field of occupational safety.  It is the sole
agency in the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety
standards enforced by DOSH. 
 
The Cal/OSHA Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of
citations and accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by DOSH for violations of occupational safety and health
standards.  It is comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public,
one member from the field of management, and one member from the field of labor. 
 
6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT 
 
The objectives of this program include: (1) interpretation and enforcement of sections of the Labor Code which relate to
wages, hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees engaged in
protected activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders (as applicable); (2) determination
and collection of unpaid wages; 3) the licensing of farm labor contractors, industrial homework firms, and talent agencies;
the certification of studio teachers; the registration of garment manufacturers, car washing and polishing businesses, and
entities and individuals using minors in door-to-door sales; and permitting for both the employment of minors in the
entertainment industry and the individuals representing or providing services to minors in the entertainment industry; (4) field
enforcement of laws governing public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed contractors, rules
governing meals and rest periods, the payment of overtime and minimum wage, the licensing of specific industries, and the
payment of wages without required deductions; (5) under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, vigorous and
targeted enforcement in partnership with state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the
"underground economy" and administration of the prevailing wage program, to determine and publish prevailing wage rates
for public works projects;  (6) enforcement of apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works projects; and (7)
management of the Electrician Certification Program that tests for the minimum standards for competency and training for

6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS 
 
The objectives of this program are to promote, develop, and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs and to
provide consultation services to program sponsors.  The Division's goal is to match the needs of workers with those of
employers, and to strengthen the apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting
workers and teaching the skills they and their employers need.

The Division administers the apprenticeship system in California.  This includes initial program approval and subsequent
oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs
and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. 
 
The California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the
general policy under which this program operates. 
 
6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers'
compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required
under the Labor Code. 
 
The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor
Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee.  Funds from these accounts are to be
disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
