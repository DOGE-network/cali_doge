1420 - BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR 
The Bureau of Automotive Repair is responsible for regulating the automotive repair marketplace and administering the Smog 
Check Program. To carry out its mandate, the Bureau educates consumers, disciplines stations and technicians, seeks 
resolution to complaints, and licenses individuals and businesses. The Bureau also administers the nation's largest motor 
vehicle emissions reduction program. To help in its clean air efforts, the Bureau also administers the Consumer Assistance 
Program (CAP). Through CAP, consumers who own a vehicle that fails a biennial inspection and who meet certain eligibility 
requirements can receive financial assistance for emissions-related repairs. Further, consumers can receive a financial 
incentive to retire their unwanted vehicle at any time and for any reason. The Bureau, in cooperation with the California Air 
Resources Board, also administers a voucher program that offers eligible consumers additional compensation toward the 
purchase of lower-emitting vehicles or transportation passes after they retire their vehicle through CAP.

1703   California Privacy Protection Agency 
The California Privacy Protection Agency’s mission is to ensure consumers are aware of their rights, businesses are well 
informed of their obligations, and vigorously enforce the law against businesses that violate consumers’ privacy rights. On 
November 3, 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, creating the California 
Privacy Protection Agency. The Agency is vested with administrative power, authority, and jurisdiction to implement and enforce 
the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (CCPA), which is aimed at protecting Californians’ personal 
information and the promotion of public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, and rights related to the collection, 
use, sale, and disclosure of personal information, including the rights of minors. 
The Agency also implements and enforces the Delete Act, which requires the Agency to host the state’s Data Broker Registry 
and, by 2026, establish an accessible deletion mechanism through which California consumers can direct registered data 
brokers to delete their non-exempt personal information. 
The Agency is governed by a five-member board, including the chairperson. The chairperson and one member of the board are 
appointed by the Governor. The Attorney General, the Senate Rules Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly each 
appoint one member. These appointments must be made from among Californians with expertise in the areas of privacy, 
technology, and consumer rights.
