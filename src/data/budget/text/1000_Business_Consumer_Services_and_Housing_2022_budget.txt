The Department of Consumer Affairs (Department) is responsible for promoting and protecting the interests of millions of 
California consumers by serving as a guardian and advocate for their health, safety, and economic well-being and by promoting 
legal and ethical standards of professional conduct. The Department helps promote good business practices and make sure 
California's consumers receive quality services by establishing minimal competency standards for approximately 250 
professions and occupations involving more than three million professionals. The Department is also an important advocate on 
consumer and business issues. In general, the Department's Boards and Bureaus provide exams and licensing, enforcement, 
complaint resolution, and education for consumers. 
In addition, the Department provides centralized services for efficiency. Specifically, Department staff investigate complaints 
against licensees; develop valid examinations for applicants for licensure; monitor and advocate for legislation; provide 
consumer education and outreach; provide legal and audit services; and provide general administrative support involving 
personnel, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, and space management. 
There are currently 26 boards, one committee, and one commission under the broad authority of the Department, and seven 
bureaus and one certification program under the direct oversight of the Department. Effective July 12, 2021, the Bureau of 
Cannabis Control was consolidated, along with the cannabis licensing and associated regulatory functions of the Department of 
Food and Agriculture and the Department of Public Health, into the Department of Cannabis Control.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education—The Budget includes $24 million General Fund over three years to provide the 
Bureau with stable funding while the Bureau develops an improved fee model for its licensees. This funding will help support 
the continuation of the Bureau’s role to protect students and consumers through the oversight of California’s private 
postsecondary educational institutions. The Budget also includes $1.5 million ongoing Private Postsecondary Education 
Administration Fund to continue operation of the Office of Student Assistance and Relief and the Student Tuition Recovery 
Fund unit, which provide mandatory services to students of private postsecondary institutions. 
• Interstate Distribution of Compounded Medications—The Budget includes $537,000 in 2022-23 and $513,000 in 2023-24 to 
implement Chapter 629, Statutes of 2021 (AB 1533). Of these amounts, $353,000 in 2022-23 and $337,000 in 2023-24, will 
enable the Board of Pharmacy to meet the obligations established in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the 
United States Food and Drug Administration to help address issues related to interstate distribution of large amounts of 
compounded drugs and allow for information sharing across jurisdictions. AB 1533 establishes the necessary reporting 
requirements for compounding pharmacies to implement the MOU.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Cannabis Tax Reform—The Budget includes statutory changes to reform cannabis taxes, provide relief to equity cannabis 
retailers, and authorize high-road cannabis employers and cannabis equity operators to claim tax credits. These policy 
changes simplify the tax structure and remove administrative burdens and costs, which reduces barriers to entry into the 
legal, regulated cannabis market. Major changes include the following: 1) effective July 1, 2022, eliminate the cultivation tax 
on all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market; 2) effective January 1, 2023, shift the point of collection and 
remittance for excise tax from distribution to retail, maintaining a 15-percent excise tax rate through 2024-25; and 3) until 
December 31, 2025, allow equity cannabis retailers who have received an equity fee waiver from the Department of 
Cannabis Control to retain 20 percent of the excise tax they collect, as a reimbursement for all costs associated with the 
collection of the cannabis excise tax; among other changes. 
• Cannabis Local Jurisdiction Retail Access Grant Program—The Budget includes $20.5 million one-time General Fund to 
establish a grant program that will provide funding to cities and counties that do not currently have a local cannabis retailer 
licensing program. This program is intended to aid localities with the development and implementation of local retail licensing 
programs and to support consumers in gaining access to regulated and tested products through an expansion of California’s 
legal marketplace. 
• Cannabis Control Fund—The Budget includes $13.6 million one-time Cannabis Control Fund in 2022-23 for the Department 
to: 1) begin activities for developing a single licensing system; 2) implement a consumer awareness campaign; and 3) 
establish a data warehouse to store and query Department data, appropriate processes and procedures to maintain data 
integrity, and data displays and visualizations for the Department's website. These efforts will enable the Department to 
analyze and better share licensing and compliance data with state partners and public stakeholders, help inform the

disclosure of personal information, including the rights of minors. 
The agency is governed by a five-member board, including the chairperson. The chairperson and one member of the board are 
appointed by the Governor. The Attorney General, the Senate Rules Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly each 
appoint one member. These appointments must be made from among Californians with expertise in the areas of privacy,

2240   Department of Housing and Community Development 
The Department of Housing and Community Development's (HCD's) mission is to promote safe, affordable homes and strong 
vibrant communities throughout California by (1) administering housing finance, economic development, and community 
development programs, (2) developing housing policy and advocating for an adequate housing supply, and (3) developing 
building codes and regulating manufactured homes and mobilehome parks. HCD also provides technical and financial 
assistance to local agencies to support community development. 
The California Housing Finance Agency's (CalHFA's) mission is to create and finance progressive housing solutions so more 
Californians have a place to call home. The Agency's Multifamily Division finances affordable rental housing through public and 
private partnerships, while its Single Family Division finances first mortgage loans and down payment assistance loans to first-
time homebuyers through a network of preferred lenders. CalHFA, a statutorily independent agency and component unit of 
state government, is not subject to Budget Act appropriation. CalHFA is displayed, for budgetary reporting purposes only, within 
HCD's budget.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
1660 - CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM 
The objective of this program is to protect the public's health, safety, and general welfare in buildings and structures designed 
for human occupancy through the enforcement of the California Health and Safety Code, including the State Housing Law, 
Employee Housing Act, Mobilehome Parks Act, Special Occupancy Parks Act, California Factory-Built Housing Law, and the 
Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act. HCD works with factory and site-built building industries, stakeholders, and other 
government agencies to review and propose the adoption of international, national, and uniform building codes as the basis for 
all residential construction in California. The program also enforces federal and state standards for the construction, safety, 
sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars. 
1665 - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) increase housing supply by providing loans and grants to develop and preserve safe 
and affordable housing for lower-income households, (2) promote economic, community, and job development by awarding 
state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and (4) monitor 
funding recipients for compliance with the terms of their contracts with the state. 
1670 - HOUSING POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) facilitate an adequate supply of housing affordable to all income groups through the 
development, promotion, and implementation of innovative housing and community development policies, practices, programs, 
and partnerships with state, regional, and local partners, (2) provide oversight for local housing plans, (3) administer planning 
and incentive grant programs, and (4) provide research, collect and analyze data, and evaluate and communicate progress in 
meeting HCD goals and outcomes. 
1675 - CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY 
CalHFA is statutorily required to maintain financial and operational independence, setting loan interest rates above its cost of 
funds and charging fees to cover its lending costs and risks. The objective of CalHFA's lending activity is to advance the 
creation and preservation of affordable housing using various lending models that facilitate: (1) mortgage loans to qualified low- 
and moderate-income homebuyers to finance the purchase of an affordable home, (2) permanent loans to create and preserve 
multifamily housing projects for low- and moderate-income residents. 
1680 - LOAN REPAYMENTS PROGRAM 
This program displays the estimated loan repayments made under HCD's Financial Assistance Program. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM 
This program provides: (1) executive leadership in designing, implementing, and communicating housing programs and 
policies, (2) fiduciary oversight and fiscal management through its audit, accounting, and budget functions, (3) development, 
review, and implementation of legislation related to HCD programs, (4) housing-specific legal expertise, and (5) support 
services in the areas of personnel, information technology, business services, and contract management.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
1700 - DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE 
The Department of Real Estate makes sure that individuals who wish to engage in real estate business and act in the capacity 
of, or advertise as, a real estate broker or salesperson within California meet specified qualifications, and ensures licensees 
meet minimum education standards and requirements. The Department investigates the actions of any person acting in the 
capacity of a real estate licensee, performs financial compliance audits of licensees and subdividers, administratively 
prosecutes violations of the Real Estate Law and Subdivided Lands Law, and provides victims of real estate fraud with financial 
recovery per limitations set by statute. The Department protects the public against fraud and misrepresentation in the sale or 
lease of subdivided land through the issuance of public reports that disclose vital information to prospective purchasers of 
subdivision interests.
