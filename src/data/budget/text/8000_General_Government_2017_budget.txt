Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training to maintain critical local law enforcement training services. 
 
Law Enforcement Driving Simulators-The Budget includes $1.8 million Motor Vehicle Account on a one-time basis to

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6500 - STANDARDS 
 
The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also
provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and
counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices. 
 
The Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures and
program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement agencies.
It also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a clearinghouse of
successful program information.  Finally, it conducts accreditation and peace officer feasibility studies. 
 
6505 - TRAINING 
 
The Training Program increases the competence of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that
meet identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses, and assisting law
enforcement agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission
assesses training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met.  The curricula cover a wide variety of
topics necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training
needs of law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly.  The Program also presents advanced
training for law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership
Institute, and for trainers through the Basic Academy Instructor Certificate Program and the Instructor Development Institute.
Other specialty programs include the Institute of Criminal Investigation. 
 
Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are
enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards. 
 
6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING 
 
The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs
associated with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses
associated with training presentations and for necessary overtime to enable line officers to receive in-service training in
areas of critical need.  To encourage and assist local law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in
the selection and training of law enforcement officers, the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties,
approximately 346 cities, and numerous specialized districts and local agencies which have agreed to meet the
Commission's standards.

by the President pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly.  The Council establishes general policy and
approves program allocations. 
 
The Council recognizes that the Arts are essential for the cultural, educational, social and economic development of
California. The Council seeks to further its mandates and services to the public through the development of partnerships with
the public and private sectors and by providing support to the state's non-profit arts and cultural community, which are
broad-based and extended across the state from its largest metropolitan areas to its most rural areas. 
 
The Council is statutorily required to: 
 
Encourage artistic awareness, participation, and expression among the citizens of California.
Help independent local groups develop their own arts programs.
Promote the employment of artists and those skilled in crafts in both the public and private sectors.
Provide for the exhibition of art works in public buildings throughout California.
Enlist the aid of all state agencies in the task of ensuring the fullest expression of our artistic potential.

DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS
 
 
8420    State Compensation Insurance Fund
 
State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was
originally enacted in 1913.  State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing
body of a private insurance carrier.  State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of
directors for approval. 
 
State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore
injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers
located in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on
policies written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California,
and the State is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the
California civil service process and are actually employees of the State. 
 
State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the State and
because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors.  However, the State of California is not
financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund. 
 
Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation
coverage and benefits for injured employees.  Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to
private employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers'
compensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and
other subdivisions of the State of California under a Master Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the State provides a
deposit out of which State Fund pays compensation benefits to injured State workers and medical benefits to health

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6570 - AGRICULTURAL PLANT AND ANIMAL HEALTH; PEST PREVENTION; FOOD SAFETY SERVICES 
 
The objective of this program is to prevent the introduction and establishment of serious plant and animal pests and
diseases to California and protect the safety of California's dairy, eggs and meat products exempt from Federal inspection.
In particular, the program is focused on pests and diseases that can: (1) be transmitted to humans, (2) inflict catastrophic
financial loss on California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses, (3) have severe negative impact on the
environment, or (4) adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the consumer. 
 
6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES 
 
California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce.  The
objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural
commodities, promote consumer protection, food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported grading
services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the
marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products. 
 
This program also provides licenses to eligible California cannabis cultivators and maintains a statewide cannabis tracking
system. 
 
This program also provides support to governmental agencies that work to protect the nation's food supply and the
environment by monitoring for chemical contaminants such as pesticides in food, animal feed and fertilizers. 
 
6580 - ASSISTANCE TO FAIRS AND COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
 
This program provides limited fiscal and policy oversight to the network of California fairs. 
 
The State has a network of 79 fairs including county fairs, citrus fruit fairs, District Agricultural Associations and the California
State Fair (an independent state agency).  State oversight of these local fairs includes attendance of board meetings and
periodic financial reviews and audits. 
 
6590 - GENERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
 
 
This program provides the fiscal and policy oversight of the federal grants awarded that promote California agriculture, and
for all CDFA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program activities which are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
agriculture. 
 
In addition, this program serves as the central point of contact for logistical coordination of all departmental resources,
provides industry and agency coordination on environmental issues affecting agriculture, and provides centralized
communications to California's agricultural industry, including County Agricultural Commissioners and the statewide
fairgrounds. 
 
This program also partially reimburses County Agricultural Commissioners' Offices for carrying out agricultural programs
authorized by the Food and Agricultural Code under the supervision of CDFA. 
 
9900 - EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES 
 
Executive and Management Services include the executive leadership of the Secretary's Office. The Secretary's Office sets
priorities and policies to protect, support, and promote agriculture in the State of California, and helps to protect the health
and welfare of the public and the environment. 
 
Administrative Services provides centralized administrative support to the Department through fiscal operations, employee-
employer relations, personnel management, employee development, and general business services.

candidates, and lobbyists, and assist with compliance.
Ensure that election campaign contribution and expenditure data is fully and accurately disclosed so that the voters may
be fully informed.
Enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations fairly and with due process.
Regulate the activities of lobbyists and disclose their finances.
Provide for the disclosure of assets and income of public officials, which may affect their official actions, to avoid conflicts
of interest or appearances of impropriety.

8660    Public Utilities Commission
 
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) regulates critical and essential services such as privately-owned
telecommunications, electric, natural gas, and water companies, in addition to overseeing railroad/rail transit and moving
and transportation companies. The PUC is the only agency in the state charged with protecting private utility consumers. As
such, the PUC is responsible for ensuring that customers have safe, reliable utility service at reasonable rates, protecting
against fraud, and promoting the health of California's economy, which depends on the infrastructure the utilities and the
PUC provide.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6680 - REGULATION OF UTILITIES 
 
Californians spend more than $50 billion annually for services from industries regulated by the PUC. This includes 6
electricity utilities (70 percent of electric load in California), 941 telecommunications carriers, 120 water and sewer utilities, 5
natural gas utilities with approximately 10.8 million customers, 4 gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home
park and propane operators. 
 
The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions
include both backward-looking investigation and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk
assessment to identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC also performs operation and maintenance audits, outage
inspections, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities. 
 
The PUC conducts triennial reviews of utility operations to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services. The
PUC provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities and other load-serving entities to follow when purchasing electricity on
behalf of their 11.8 million customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and where needed in
the state. Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation and promotion of
ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, the state's mandated renewable energy programs, and other clean energy
programs. 
 
Natural gas rate regulation encompasses setting natural gas rates and overseeing services, including in-state transportation
over the utilities' transmission and distribution pipeline systems, storage, procurement, metering, and billing. 
 
The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate
discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost

8660    Public Utilities Commission - Continued
weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria. 
 
The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for
transmission, telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects. 
 
The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including
removing barriers to a fully competitive market; enforcing customer service standards for telecommunication services;
regulating basic and rural telecommunication rates; protecting consumers against telecommunications fraud; promoting
widespread access to advanced video technology, and developing programs to bridge the "digital divide." 
 
The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to
their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water and sewer service quality,
promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and processing rate change
requests, and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements. 
 
The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in
participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in
proceedings. The Consumer Affairs Branch responds to questions regarding utility service and bills, and assists consumers
who have unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. A Supplier Diversity program promotes
and monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse. 
 
6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELEPHONE PROGRAMS 
 
The PUC oversees approximately $850 million in telecommunications programs including the California Lifeline Fund,
California Teleconnect Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, and California High Cost Funds, all of which
provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these "universal telephone service" programs
include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) encouraging consumer choice among
competitive telephone companies; (3) modifying, as necessary, the basic telephone service definition to incorporate new
technology; and (4) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make informed choices about basic service
and universal lifeline telephone services. The California Teleconnect Fund program provides discounted telecommunication
services to qualifying schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The California Advanced Services
Fund Program encourages the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved rural and urban areas
of California. 
 
6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION 
 
The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in
California. All railroads, 7 major rail transit agencies, 6 smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private
crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-
certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and
appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of
hazardous materials by rail. 
 
For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train
control, and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or
disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, and crossing safety treatments deployed at each
crossing. Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing
hazard elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-
separating highway/rail crossings. 
 
The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation
companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, and charter and scheduled bus operators), privately-owned water ferries, and
household goods carriers. The program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety
standards and insurance requirements, and protects consumers from moving companies and for-hire passenger carriers
operating illegally. 
 
6695 - OFFICE OF RATEPAYER ADVOCATES 
 
The mandate and function of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The
ORA is a statutorily-defined state entity charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility customers and
subscribers in all significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction. 
 
Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the ORA with a director appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the
Governor and charged the ORA with representing ratepayer interests in Commission proceedings. Chapter 1005, Statutes of
1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement Account to be transferred in
the annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account. The law further required that "funds
in the Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account shall be utilized exclusively by the division in the
performance of its duties as determined by the director" [of ORA], and that the budget be submitted to the Commission for
approval.  
 
Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that ORA only represent ratepayers in PUC proceedings. SB
201 extended ORA's representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the Energy Commission, Air Resources
Board, California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings.

GENERAL GOVERNMENT
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range.  Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
 
8660    Public Utilities Commission - Continued
 
Chapter 440, Statutes of 2005 (SB 608), required the PUC to provide personnel and resources to ORA, including attorneys
and other legal support, sufficient to ensure that customer and subscriber interests are effectively represented in all
significant proceedings. The law also authorized the ORA director to appoint a lead attorney to represent the division and
that "all attorneys assigned by the Commission to perform services for the division shall report to and be directed by the lead
attorney appointed by the Director" [of ORA]. 
 
Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013 (SB 96), requires the creation of an independent ORA program budget administered and
utilized exclusively by ORA, subject to review and approval by the Department of Finance. SB 96 also requires the ORA
director to employ personnel and resources, including attorneys and other legal support staff, at a level sufficient to ensure
that customer and subscriber interests are effectively represented in all significant proceedings.

8780    Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government
Organization and Economy
 
The Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy (Commission) is
the state's only independent and citizen-based oversight mechanism.  It conducts four to five comprehensive reviews of
executive branch programs, departments, and agencies each year and recommends ways to improve performance by
increasing efficiency and effectiveness with existing resources. The Commission is statutorily responsible for analyzing and
making recommendations to the Legislature on all Governor reorganization plans. 
 
The Commission is composed of two members of the Senate, two members of the Assembly, and nine unpaid citizen
members - five appointed by the Governor and four appointed by the Legislature. 
 
Because of the Commission's independence, the Legislature charged it with oversight of the California State Auditor,
including contracting with an independent auditor for annually examining the State Audit Fund.

The Commission on Disability Access was established in 2008 pursuant to Chapter 549, Statutes of 2008, and subsequently
redefined pursuant to Chapter 383, Statutes of 2012, to study existing disability access requirements and compliance, and to
promote better compliance with existing laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the California
Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Commission also acts as an information center on disability access compliance statutes and
regulations, coordinates with state agencies and local building departments, and prevents or minimizes compliance
problems by California businesses. Lastly, the Commission develops recommendations that enable persons with disabilities
to exercise their right to full and equal access to public facilities, and facilitate business compliance with laws and regulations
to avoid unnecessary litigation. 
 
Effective July 1, 2017, the Commission was transferred to the Department of General Services.

8855    California State Auditor's Office
 
The California State Auditor (State Auditor) promotes the effective and efficient administration and management of public
funds and programs by providing citizens and government officials nonpartisan, accurate, and objective assessments of
state and local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants
the State Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-
created entity. The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute
or requested by the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is
responsible for annually conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the
State's basic financial statements and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The
Single Audit is federally required as a condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the
Legislature enacted a program that requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial
courts in 2012-13 and thereafter biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five

judicial branch entities - which includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. 
 
The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud,
abuse, and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the
authority to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk.  Similar to the state high-risk
program, Chapter 451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to
identify local government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high
risk for the potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their
economy, efficiency, or effectiveness.  Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local
entities. 
 
Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform
independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts.
The State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of
improper acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law. 
 
The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an
application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10
years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and
conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6770 - STATE BUDGET 
 
To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance
advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget.  The Governor's
Budget contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and
proposed expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of
Finance assists in the administration of the budget.  The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state
agencies and programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within
existing resources, and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the
Governor. Basic and applied economic and tax research functions support the revenue estimates required for the
development of the state financial plan, for the analysis of financial legislation, and the evaluation of economic trends or
other fiscal developments which affect the state. Basic and applied demographic research functions provide data to support
the workload estimates of state agencies. 
 
6775 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA (FI$Cal) PROJECT SUPPORT 
 
The Department of Finance is one of four partner agencies responsible for the development, implementation, utilization, and
maintenance of an integrated statewide financial management system, FI$Cal.  This program includes Department of
Finance subject-matter experts assigned to the FI$Cal Project. 
 
6780 - STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS 
 
The Department of Finance systematically reviews and evaluates state-administered and financed programs.  The Office of
State Audits and Evaluations assists the Director of Finance in fulfilling the statutory responsibilities for supervision over all
matters concerning the financial and business policies of the state by conducting financial audits and by performing critical
examinations of state programs and policies including the oversight activities associated with the dissolution of
redevelopment agencies.  Effective July 1, 2017, Program 6800 (Local Government Audits and Evaluations) merged with
Program 6780. 
 
6785 - STATEWIDE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONSULTING AND TRAINING 
 
The Statewide Accounting Policies, Consulting and Training Unit sets statewide accounting policies and procedures.  The
unit provides fiscal consulting, training, and support services to departments to help ensure that the state's assets are
protected and accurate, and timely financial information is maintained.  The unit maintains a uniform and complete
accounting system for state departments and participates in the development of other statewide financial systems.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
6911 - NATIONAL GUARD 
 
The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our
State Military Reserve.  Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics,
communications, law enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air
defense, airlift and unmanned aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services.  The
Office of the Adjutant General element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such
as personnel and fiscal resource management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information
technology. The Military Civil Support element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so
that mutual understanding and unity of purpose is assured during an emergency.  The objectives of this element are to plan,
prepare, and train for the deployment of Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called
to state service by the Governor due to domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and
other public agencies with the coordination necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Military Reserve is
a volunteer component of the Military Department whose mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during
training, preparation for mobilization, demobilization, and provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state
emergencies. The federal government provides virtually all supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support
services necessary for training, deployment, and commitment of the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance
with the Department of the Army and Air Force Regulations and Training Guidance. 
 
6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS 
 
The Military Department manages the following seven programs while serving more than 12,000 youth annually:  California
Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy,
STARBASE Academy Sacramento and STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911
by the California Legislature and then-Adjutant General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program
that is designed to provide maximum growth and leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school
levels.  It provides leadership opportunities for cadets by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as
leaders in their cadet military units, and by demonstrating proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their
communities. As part of their training, cadets provide assistance and support to the school and community. The Oakland
Military Institute College Preparatory Academy develops leaders of character by providing a rigorous seven-year college
preparatory program to promote excellence in the four pillars of academics, leadership, citizenship, and athletics. Using a
military framework, the goal of Oakland Military Institute is to graduate cadets who are capable of meeting the admissions
requirements for any college in the nation and who are prepared for their roles as future leaders. The mission of the National
Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is to intervene in and reclaim the lives of 16-18 year old high school dropouts. Graduates
leave the program with the values, life skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as productive citizens.  The
goal of the Department of Defense STARBASE program is to motivate elementary school students, primarily 5th graders, to
explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as they continue their education. The curriculum is designed to
increase student involvement and interest in STEM, enhance their understanding of the role that STEM literacy plays in their
lives, strengthen potential for future careers, and make the pursuit of STEM activities more attractive and accessible. While
attending STARBASE students interact with military personnel to explore careers and observe STEM applications in the
"real world." These seven youth programs are financed with federal, state and local funds. The California National Guard is
involved in youth programs because political and community leaders at the federal, state, and local levels recognize that the
National Guard brings structure, discipline, and effective leadership training methods to the educational setting.

This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public
purposes by promoting patriotism, by recognizing and rewarding sacrifice and service to country, and by providing needed
readjustment assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to their
country's call to military service. 
 
Because the CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, it has a capital outlay program to support this
need. For the specifics on the CalVet's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

Cemeteries, California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education, Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program,
Veterans Mental Health Program including Veteran Justice Outreach and Incarcerated Veterans, Homeless Veterans
Outreach Program, and the Veterans License Plate Program.  California, with approximately 1.8 million veterans, represents
8.2 percent of the nation's total veteran population. 
 
7000 - CARE OF SICK AND DISABLED VETERANS 
 
CalVet operates eight licensed long term care facilities which provide affordable, quality long term care to all eligible
veterans and their spouses. The Veterans Homes also provide therapeutic care and rehabilitative services to help increase
activities of daily living and independent function. The primary objectives of these Veterans Homes are: 
 
The Veterans Home of California, Barstow offers skilled nursing, intermediate, and domiciliary care.
The Veterans Home of California, Chula Vista offers skilled nursing, residential care for the elderly, and domiciliary care.
The Veterans Home of California, Fresno offers skilled nursing, including memory care, and residential care for the
elderly.
The Veterans Home of California, Greater Los Angeles and Ventura County (GLAVC), includes three main campuses:
West Los Angeles (WLA), Lancaster, and Ventura. All three offer residential care for the elderly. The WLA campus also
offers skilled nursing care, including memory care, and domiciliary care in the form of a transitional housing program.
The Veterans Home of California, Redding offers skilled nursing, including memory care, and residential care.
The Veterans Home of California, Yountville is the largest veterans home in the United States. It offers all four levels of
care: skilled nursing, intermediate, residential care for the elderly, and domiciliary care. The skilled nursing also includes a
memory care facility with a supervised environment.
 
7005 - VETERANS MEMORIALS 
 
This program is responsible for the beautification and enhancement of the California Mexican American Veterans Memorial
on state grounds through private contributions. 
 
This program also supports the Veterans Registry, which is part of the California Veterans Memorial.  The provided
contributions help to defray the costs of data entry and system management for the Registry and the reasonable costs that
are incurred by the CalVet for administering the fund. 
 
9900 - GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 
 
This program provides for the executive management of the CalVet's full range of programs and administrative support.
Functions include information services, budgeting, accounting, personnel, and business services.  These costs are
distributed to the major programs.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) facilities include eight veterans homes, three state veterans cemeteries, and
two office buildings. The eight veterans homes are located in Yountville, Barstow, Chula Vista, Ventura, Lancaster, West Los
Angeles, Redding and Fresno on 766 acres of land, with 2.4 million gross square feet of building space. Veterans homes
provide domiciliary housing for the state's veterans and are also licensed to provide three levels of care, ranging from
assisted living to skilled nursing. The three cemeteries operated by CalVet are located in Igo, near Redding, Yountville, and
Seaside, and contain a total of approximately 24,000 gravesites on 91 usable acres. A fourth state cemetery is in the study
phase, and will be located on 125 acres in Southern California, known as the Bake Parkway site.

9100    Tax Relief
 
This budget provides funding for cities and counties to help defray the loss of revenue as a result of the Homeowners'
Property Tax Relief Program, that provides California homeowners assistance through a $7,000 exemption from property
tax, and the Open Space Subventions Program, that provides tax relief to individuals who agreed to hold their land as open
space under the Williamson Act of 1965.  In addition, this budget receives the excess funds from loan repayments from
individuals who participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program, and provides funding to help cities
and counties accurately report population data for the 2020 United States Census.

scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, Section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to
be assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties
to partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program. 
 
7510 - SENIOR CITIZENS' PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT LOAN REPAYMENTS 
 
The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program allows eligible homeowners to defer payment of residential
property tax. The state pays the deferred taxes to local governments on behalf of the participants, and places a lien on their
property to assure repayment when the property is sold or transferred. The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement
Loan Repayments Program captures repayments from individuals that participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax
Postponement Program and transfers to the General Fund the amount in excess of what is required to fund the
Postponement Program claims. The Program was suspended in 2009 and was reestablished via legislation in 2014 (Chapter
703, Statutes of 2014).    
 
7520 - LOCAL UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESS PROGRAM 
 
The Local Update of Census Address Program provides population-based incentive grants of between $7,500 and $125,000
to cities and counties, to ensure they participate in the review and update of the United States Census Bureau's Master
Address List for the 2020 Census.

This budget establishes a process and mechanism for counties to request funding if court construction projects, occupied on
or after October 9, 2011, modify or create building features that increase overall trial court security costs.  Trial Court
Security was realigned from the state to counties through 2011 Public Safety Realignment.  Proposition 30, passed by the
voters in 2012, requires the state to provide annual funding for newly required activities that have an overall effect of
increasing county costs in this realigned program.

1 Totals reflect Build America Bond subsidy.
2 General Obligation bond expenditures include repayment of debt service for various departments funded by a series of bonds; however, the state may assign each 
maturity of the bonds to one or more departments, rather than having all of the debt allocated to a department mature proportionally across the entire maturity schedule.  
Regardless of the debt service allocated among departments, the aggregate debt service obligation of the state remains the same.
3 Includes Higher Education debt service paid through UC and CSU main budget items. 
General Obligation Bond Expenditures
9610    Lease-Revenue Notes and Bonds
 
This budget is limited to those long-term lease arrangements, generally resulting in a capital acquisition or improvement, for
which a bond has been issued as the underlying source of funds.  This budget reflects expenditures for the appropriations
necessary for the lease payments that are contained in the support budgets of the affected departments or agencies and
may vary from this display because of reimbursements from bond surplus accounts.  This display is intended to meet the
needs of the financial community for summary information relating to lease-revenue debt.

In accordance with Government Code section 63049.1, the Enhanced Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed Bonds item
appropriates $1,000 and authorizes the Director of Finance to allocate up to $200 million General Fund if tobacco settlement
revenues are insufficient to pay the costs of debt service and operating expenses. While this authority was necessary to sell
the Tobacco Settlement Revenue backed bonds, it is not anticipated that the General Fund will be required to make any
payments.

The Cash Management and Budgetary Loans budget tracks General Fund expenditures for interest costs related to cash
flow and budgetary borrowing.  Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow
imbalances during the fiscal year.  Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the
General Fund may need to borrow even though its budget is balanced.  This short-term borrowing for cash flow purposes
does not indicate fiscal weakness and may be preferable to carrying too large a General Fund reserve.  Budgetary loans

7720 - CASH MANAGEMENT 
 
Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities 
 
Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to
as "borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted.  Those provisions, in
slightly modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables
the General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent.  The use of these
funds' money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds.  This mechanism does not
interfere with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method.  Generally, when a
fund is designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State
Controller's Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund
cash shortage.  For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund.  The entire
cash balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes. 
 
A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79,
Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state
entity that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA.  The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500
million and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion.  There are currently no deposits in
this program.

9620    Cash Management and Budgetary Loans - Continued
A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033,
Government Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing
additional liquidity for the state's cash management.  The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the
maximum amount for the VIP from all local entities combined is $10 billion.  No deposits have been made into this program. 
 
 
Borrowing From Financial Markets 
 
In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this
doctrine, an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section
1 of Article XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This
doctrine was invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and
again in 1971 to validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions
were invoked in 1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like
registered warrants, required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes
provisions were re-enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84. 
 
In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided
the flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external
funds results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which
the General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. 
 
External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation
warrants (RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs).  RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in
anticipation of receiving revenues in the near future. 
 
Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any
other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow. 
 
 
Overall Program 
 
Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for
the past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts
nor disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. In order to reflect cash flow,
budget data is converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the
Controller and for accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and
administrative actions. 
 
The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and
assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used
from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year. 
 
7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS 
 
The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are being
repaid over multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are being repaid with interest calculated at
the Pooled Money Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS
 
 
9625    Interest Payments to the Federal Government
 
Pursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), the state will incur an interest liability to the federal
government.  The purpose of CMIA is to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the exchange of funds
between the federal government and the state.  The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely
fund disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds
in the state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal
government from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state
account; and (d) the federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the
state account until the funds are paid out for program purposes. 
 
The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $273 million or more in federal fund
expenditures.  For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e.,
check) issuance.  State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be
deposited before the warrants are issued. 
 
Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year.  The payment will be for the interest
liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

9650    Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants
 
This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents. 
 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health
plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was
added in 1982. 
 
The 2016-17 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula
established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested members. Under this formula, the state averages the
premiums of the four largest health benefit plans in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards
retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the
retiree's dependents.  Vesting schedules and employer contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract. 
 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are
determined on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2016 monthly
contribution maximums are $705 for a single enrollee, $1,343 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee
and two or more dependents. The 2017 monthly contribution maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an
enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan
and number of dependents. 
 
Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code
6645 under Higher Education.  This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.

This item will prefund other post-employment benefits (OPEB), specifically retiree health and dental benefits. 
 
Pursuant to Chapter 2, Statutes of 2016 (AB 133), a one-time allocation of $240 million General Fund was made to pay
down the state's unfunded liability for OPEB. 
 
Future adjustments for prefunding retiree health and dental benefits will be made directly through department appropriations.
Information regarding prefunding trust assets can be found in the Fund Condition Statement for the Annuitants' Health Care
Coverage Fund displayed in the Public Employees' Retirement System (Org 7900).

DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS
 
 
9658    Budget Stabilization Account
 
Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization
Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. 
 
Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers
between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years.  In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a
calculated amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities. 
 
Prior to passage of Proposition 2, Proposition 58, as approved by the voters in March 2004, established the BSA, and
required the State Controller to transfer a specified percentage of estimated General Fund revenues from the General Fund
to the BSA.  The Legislature could transfer, by statute, amounts in excess of the specified percentage to the BSA.  In
addition, the Governor, by executive order, could suspend the transfer to the BSA.  Half of the funds transferred to the BSA
were used to retire Economic Recovery Bonds authorized in Proposition 57 (March 2004).  Proposition 2 strengthened the
reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the
BSA, and increasing the reserve limit. 
 
LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY
 
PROGRAM AUTHORITY 
 
Section 20, Article XVI of the Constitution of the State of California. 
 
Control Section 35.50, Budget Act. 
 
 
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy
day" 50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital
gains over 8 percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50
percent to pay down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy
day," reduced by any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates  to pay down debt.  The maximum balance
in the BSA is limited to 10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes.  Any amounts in excess of ten percent will be used
for specified infrastructure needs. 
 
Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years, if applicable. 
 
The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds
from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for
appropriation in the immediately preceding fiscal year. 
 
Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years.  This will
smooth school spending and minimize future cuts.  The Proposition 98 reserve does not change the Proposition 98 minimum
guarantee calculation and transfers will not occur until various operational and economic conditions are met.

9800    Augmentation for Employee Compensation
 
This item reflects funding augmentations for state employee compensation. If the Legislature previously appropriated
money, through this budget item, to pay for the economic terms of employee compensation in previous fiscal years, the
funding for those economic terms is included in departments' budgets. When economic terms require funding not yet
appropriated by the Legislature, those funds are included in this budget item.

9818    Federal Levy of State Funds
 
The federal courts periodically issue judgments or "writs of execution" against the State of California requiring the state to
make payments to the federal government.  The writs and judgments provide the authority to the federal government to
withdraw funds from the state bank accounts maintained by the State Treasurer's Office at the various state depository
banks. 
 
Each year, the Budget Act authorizes the Department of Finance to identify specific appropriations or funds to charge when
the federal government withdraws funds from state bank accounts.   When no specific appropriation or fund can be
identified, the withdrawals are charged to the unappropriated General Fund balance. 
 
No levies were paid during the 2015-16 fiscal year and none have been paid through June 15, 2017. 
 
LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY

The Governor's Budget (Budget) appropriates funding to be allocated by the Department of Finance to state agencies to
develop design and cost information for new projects. 
 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Budget appropriates funding to be allocated by the Department of Finance to state agencies to develop more refined
scope, cost, and schedule information for new projects to ensure estimated project costs are more accurate, funding levels
are appropriate, and the project scope is feasible. 
 
SUMMARY OF PROJECTS
 
 
DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS 
 
 
9885    Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances
 
For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not
yet been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure
totals. This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department
budgets. 
 
For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that
encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services.  Furthermore,
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General
Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and
state policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide
adjustment to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government
Code Section 13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary
Schedule 1 for the General Fund.

COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT 
 
The State Controller's Office accumulated a preliminary estimated General Fund encumbrance total of $979,901,000 from
2015-16 year-end financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are
estimated to be at the same level for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within
the next fiscal year. The Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the
encumbrance adjustment.

9900    Statewide General Administrative Expenditures (Pro Rata)
Central service agencies, such as Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, the State Controller, and Legislature, provide
budgeting, banking, accounting, auditing, payroll, and other services to all state departments.  The Pro Rata process
apportions the costs of providing central administrative services to all state departments and funding sources that benefit
from the services.  Amounts apportioned to special funds for their fair share of central administrative services costs are
transferred from the special funds to the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund. 
Prior to 2016-17, Pro Rata charges to special funds were normally included in the appropriate departmental budgets.  This
budget item included Pro Rata costs directly charged to special funds for those cases where appropriate funding was not
provided for in departmental budgets.  Effective 2016-17, this budget item includes Pro Rata costs charged directly at the
fund level, rather than each individual appropriation, pursuant to Government Code section 11274.
