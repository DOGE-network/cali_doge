Education 
Education programs provide academic services 
segmented by pre-kindergarten, elementary, 
secondary, undergraduate and graduate programs 
as well as credentialing services to ensure 
schools are staffed with effective instructors. 
Elementary and secondary instruction is provided 
to all of California's children to prepare them for 
higher education or entry into the workforce. 
Institutions of higher education provide further 
access to the skills necessary for career goals and 
participation in a globally competitive workforce, 
as well as conducting research and providing 
public services. 
6100   Department of Education 
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million 
students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Access for All Branch; the Operations 
and Administration Branch; the Opportunities for All Branch; the Instruction and Measurement Branch; and the Legal and 
Audits Branch. 
 
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to 
work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding 
local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to 
enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and 
supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that 
promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the 
administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing 
broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering 
systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help 
students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that 
promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the Department. 
Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals by 
K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of 
substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory 
timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits, including Local School Construction Bond Audits and School Facility 
Program Bond Fund Audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear standards for compliance with education funding requirements, and 
allow both the state and local educational agencies to avoid lengthy and expensive litigation over disputed funding.

6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System 
The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). 
The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members' 
creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an 
additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on 
July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three 
years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase 
the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 
The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in 
quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing 
power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection 
payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to 
set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to 
CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an 
amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding 
calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15 
of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’ 
Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) 
increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 
DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY 
Education Code, Title 1, Division 1, Part 13, Chapter 16. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $3.9 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS in 2021-22. The roughly $435 million 
increase from the previous fiscal year is largely due to payroll growth and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to 
exercise its authority to increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy 
signed into law in 2014. The Budget also includes $174 million one-time General Fund to offset the reduction in the state's 
contributions in 2020-21. 
• The Budget includes a $410 million supplemental pension payment in 2021-22 towards the state’s share of the Defined 
Benefit Program's unfunded liability to be paid out of Proposition 2 debt funding.

6350   School Facilities Aid Program 
The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities 
such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.  This program is administered by the State Allocation 
Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 
The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility 
Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in 
statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.  These funds primarily 
support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through 
the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding 
relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7) 
seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general 
obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 
billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical 
education projects.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure 
a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 280,000 applications annually for 
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the 
primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential 
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 
The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas, 
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including 
the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and 
development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the 
Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to 
monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of 
program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program 
approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated 
assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal 
advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of 
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and 
applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct 
disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions. 
5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES 
This program provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission in credential holder discipline 
cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process. 
5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT 
The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher 
preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface. 
5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS 
This program supports development and implementation of Performance Assessments for credential candidates in preparation 
programs that lead to a teaching or administrative services credential.  In addition to ensuring that credential candidates are

prepared to enter the teaching profession or serve as a school administrator, candidate scores from these assessments will be 
included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment. 
5388 - CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING GRANT PROGRAM 
This program provides grants to K-12 local educational agencies to support recruitment of non-certificated school employees to 
participate in a teacher preparation program and become certificated classroom teachers in California public schools. 
5397 - EDUCATOR PREPARATION 
Provides funding for competitive grants to local educational agencies to recruit, prepare, and retain credentialed K-12 
educators. 
5399 - ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and internal 
administrative support services.

The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic 
programs through the doctoral degree level; research; continuing education for adult learners; and public service. 
UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 1879 as 
a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the following 26 
members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms, 
and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents. 
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. In 
addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment primarily 
responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 
There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa 
Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education. 
The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and 
administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States 
Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories. 
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource 
allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated 
authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs. 
Because UC’s programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, UC has a capital outlay program to support this need. For 
the specifics on UC's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview.”

6445   California Institute for Regenerative Medicine 
Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, was approved by California voters on November 2, 2004, 
providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for stem cell research conducted at California universities, research 
institutions, and companies. It also established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to make grants and loans for 
stem cell research. The Institute's mission is to accelerate stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs. 
Proposition 14, the Stem Cell Research Institute Bond Initiative, was approved by California voters on November 8, 2020, 
authorized $5.5 billion in new general obligation bonds and increased the Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee from 29 
to 35 members, among other administrative and oversight changes. 
The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 35-member governing board for the Institute. The members are public 
officials, appointed on the basis of their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and research 
institutions, patient advocacy groups, and the life sciences biotechnology industry.The 2021-22 Budget Act displays a point in 
time snapshot of the Institute's proposed budget that was finalized prior to the passage of Proposition 14 and is based on the 
assumption of expiring Proposition 71 bond authority and declining resources over the next one to two years. Due to the 
difference in the timing of the Institute’s Oversight Board budget meeting and regular state budget deliberations, the Institute’s 
new bond funding will be reflected at the 2022-23 Governor’s Budget.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5530 - This program provides support for Hastings. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 
INSTRUCTION 
Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal 
profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 
The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal 
profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students 
with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism 
for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in 
overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 
The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference 
and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom 
presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law 
library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
Student services include admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support 
Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices provide 
students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist 
students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment 
opportunities. These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support 
Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other 
services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety, 
community relations, and administrative services. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and 
administration of maintenance and renovation activities for the college's plant. 
EXTRAMURAL 
Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. These 
include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate 
instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal arts education programs. For undergraduate programs, each 
campus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to master's-
level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and 
audiology. The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 
The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16 
members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student 
representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year 
term by the CSU Alumni Council. The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the 
Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty 
representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 
The CSU’s goals include to: 
• Advance and extend knowledge, learning, and culture, especially throughout California. 
• Provide opportunities for individuals to develop intellectually, personally, and professionally. 
• Prepare significant numbers of educated, responsible people to contribute to California’s schools, economy, culture, and 
future. 
• Encourage and provide access to an excellent education to all who are prepared for and wish to participate in collegiate 
study. 
• Offer undergraduate and graduate instruction leading to bachelor’s and higher degrees in the liberal arts and sciences, 
applied fields, and the professions, including the doctoral degree when authorized. 
• Prepare students for international, multi-cultural society. 
• Provide public services that enrich the university and its communities.

6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants 
This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their 
dependents. 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan. 
Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 
The 2020-21 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established

in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members 
hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest 
health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also 
contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2020 monthly contribution 
maximums are $767 for a single enrollee, $1,461 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,868 for an enrollee and two or 
more dependents. The 2021 monthly contribution maximums are $798 for a single enrollee, $1,519 for an enrollee and one 
dependent, and $1,937 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges 
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 
California's 73 community college districts, which operate 116 community colleges. The Board has 17 voting members and 1 
nonvoting member as specified in statute. Twelve members are appointed by the Governor, require Senate approval for six-
year terms, and must include two current or former local board members. Five members are appointed by the Governor to two-
year terms and include two students, two faculty members, and one classified member. The Lieutenant Governor also serves 
as a member of the Board. 
The objectives of the Board are to: 
• Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 
• Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 
• Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 
related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see 
"Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5755 - FINANCIAL AID GRANTS PROGRAM 
This program provides grants and other kinds of financial aid to help undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at eligible 
institutions pay for educational expenses.  The financial aid programs are described below. 
CAL GRANT PROGRAM 
Cal Grant entitlement awards are guaranteed to students who graduate from high school and meet financial, academic, and 
other general program eligibility requirements.  The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are guaranteed 
to certain community college students who have a community college grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.4 on a four-point 
scale. 
Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility 
requirements.  These awards are offered to applicants who do not receive an entitlement award. 
Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 GPA on 
a four-point scale. 
Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point scale. 
The award is for books and living expenses for the first year.  Beginning with the second year, the award also provides funds for 
tuition and fees. 
The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the 
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU).  The annual Budget Act sets the award amount 
for recipients attending private nonprofit or private, for-profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of 
Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the award for recipients attending private, for-profit institutions that are not WASC-
accredited. 
The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training. 
The Cal Grant Students with Dependent Children Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for students 
with dependent children attending the UC, CSU, or a California Community College. 
The Cal Grant Foster Youth Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for current and former foster 
youth attending the UC, CSU, or a California Community College. 
The Cal Grant B Service Incentive Grant Program provides grants to undocumented Cal Grant B recipients who are exempt 
from paying nonresident tuition and complete community or volunteer service at a qualifying organization. 
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 
The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students of no more than 40 percent of 
the UC or CSU mandatory systemwide tuition and fees. 
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS 
The California Chafee Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 to eligible foster youth who are enrolled in college or 
vocational school at least half-time.  New and renewal awards are made based on available funding. 
The California Military Department GI Bill Award Program provides funding for active members of the California National Guard, 
the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia who seek a certificate, degree, or diploma.  Recipients attending the UC, CSU or 
a private institution may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant A award.  Recipients attending a community college may 
receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant B award.  An award used for graduate studies may not exceed the maximum amount 
of a Cal Grant A award plus $500 for books and supplies. 
 
The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents (LEPD) Scholarship Program provides college grants equivalent to Cal Grant 
amounts to dependents of California law enforcement officers, officers and employees of the Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation, and firefighters killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. 
The Golden State Teacher Grant Program provides one-time grants of up to $20,000 to students enrolled in a teacher 
preparation program who commit to teaching in a high-needs subject area for four years at a qualifying school. 
The Golden State Education and Training Program provides one-time grants to eligible California workers who were displaced 
from employment due to COVID-19 and are seeking to access an educational or training program at a public postsecondary 
institution or training from a provider included on the Eligible Training Provider List.

The Learning Aligned Employment Program provides one-time grants to participating public postsecondary education 
institutions for the purposes of offering eligible students with the opportunity to earn money to help defray their educational 
costs, while gaining valuable education-aligned, career-related experience. 
 
LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAMS 
The Assumption Program of Loans for Education (APLE) issues agreements for loan assumptions to students and district 
interns who are pursuing careers in teaching and credentialed teachers teaching at certain schools.  A participant who teaches 
a total of four years can receive up to $11,000 for outstanding student loans.  APLE participants who teach in the areas of 
math, science, or education specialist instruction in a school ranked in the lowest 60 percentile of the API may receive an 
additional $1,000 per year in loan assumption benefits.  Participants meeting this requirement who provide teaching service in 
a public school ranked in the lowest 20 percentile of the API may receive an additional $1,000 per year.  The total possible loan 
assumption benefit is $19,000. 
The State Nursing Assumption Program of Loans for Education for Nursing Faculty (SNAPLE NF) allows the state to issue 
agreements for loan assumption to persons who have completed at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing or a field related to 
nursing and agreed to teach at one or more regionally-accredited, eligible California colleges or universities.  A participant can 
receive up to $8,333 annually for three years toward outstanding student loans for a total loan assumption of up to $25,000. 
The John R. Justice Program provides loan repayments to eligible recipients currently employed as California prosecutors or 
public defenders who commit to continued employment in that capacity for at least three years.  Recipients may receive up to 
$5,000 of loan repayment disbursed annually to their lending institutions. 
OUTREACH PROGRAMS 
The California Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal-SOAP), through intersegmental consortia, provides financial aid 
outreach and tutoring services to disadvantaged K-12 students, increases their access to postsecondary education, and 
informs students about opportunities for career technical education.  Cal-SOAP also assists the matriculation of community 
college students to four-year institutions. 
Cash for College provides financial aid workshops to assist low-income students with completing the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid and the Cal Grant GPA Verification Form and understanding financial aid. 
5770 - EVERY KID COUNTS ACT 
The Every Kid Counts Act Program provides local and regional organizations with funds to match investment in or incentives 
for individual family college savings accounts and establishes outreach efforts to educate families about local college savings 
accounts. 
5775 - CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRANT PROGRAM
