3900   Air Resources Board 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air 
pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for 
Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40 
percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 
32). The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's 
most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with air 
pollution control distrcts, the business community, scientists, community representatives and other stakeholders to implement 
all of its programs. 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Clean Vehicle Rebates—$238 million of Cap and Trade funding for the Air Resources Board to provide rebates to California 
residents for the purchase or lease of new light-duty zero-emission vehicles and plug-in hybrids to help the state achieve its 
zero-emission vehicle target. This represents an additional $38 million above the $200 million 2018-19 funding level for 
Clean Vehicle Rebates. 
• Wildfire Prevention and Recovery Legislative Package (SB 1260)—The Budget includes $3.4 million Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction Fund in 2019-20 for the Air Resources Board to address workload associated with recently chaptered wildfire 
prevention and recovery legislation, including air quality and smoke monitoring, forecasting, reporting, and modeling to 
support an increase in statewide prescribed burn projects.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE 
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as 
follows: 
• Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations limiting criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and toxic air 
contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assess the effectiveness of established 
procedures. 
• Develop testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuel additives, and test 
equipment to ensure emission standards are met.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
3900   Air Resources Board - Continued
2019-20 STATE BUDGET — EP 3
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Stationary Source Program works to reduce emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as 
follows: 
• Develop, implement, and enforce measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by the 
California Clean Air Act and work with local air pollution control districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient air 
quality standards. 
• Identify substances that are toxic air contaminants and develop, implement, and enforce measures to control toxic air 
contaminant emissions from stationary sources. 
3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 40 percent 
below 1990 levels by 2030, as follows: 
• Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission reductions 
and other requirements of AB 32 and SB 32. 
• Develop, implement, and oversee programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, and other 
incentive programs. 
3515 - SUBVENTION 
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air pollution control districts to encourage and support effective district 
programs. The state's 35 local air pollution control districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary sources of air 
pollution in California. 
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM 
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing 
competitive funding to advance implementation of zero/near-zero emission warehouses and technology. The intent of the 
program is to develop state-of-the-art facilities with the lowest possible emissions. 
3530 - THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM 
The Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in California's most burdened communities as follows: 
• Identify priority communities most burdened by cumulative air pollution impacts. 
• Develop and implement community emission reduction and community monitoring programs. 
• Develop and implement a technology clearinghouse. 
• Develop and implement a statewide uniform system of annual emissions reporting.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Air Resources Board has 58 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 57 sites are occupied through 
lease, permit, or license agreements. Of the non state-owned sites, 35 support air-monitoring stations and 22 sites support an 
array of vehicle testing, research, planning, enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs; 
some of the support sites are also equipped with an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air 
Resources Board oversees to support its statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's 
exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air 
Resources Board leadership role related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.
