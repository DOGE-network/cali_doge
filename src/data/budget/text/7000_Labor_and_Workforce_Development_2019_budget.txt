PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5900 - EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT RELATED SERVICES 
The objective of the Employment and Employment Related Services Program is to provide a variety of services to facilitate a 
match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an internet labor exchange system to facilitate 
this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are designed to 
provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans,

youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited 
locations designed for executive, technical, and professional job seekers to assist each other in finding suitable employment. 
5915 - CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD 
The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board is a quasi-judicial agency whose primary purpose is to conduct 
impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax 
liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one 
each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly. 
The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition, the 
Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit 
programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction. 
5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM 
The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California 
workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income 
replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own. 
5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM 
The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing 
monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who take 
time off from work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent-in-
law or to bond with a new minor child. 
5930 - TAX PROGRAM 
The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax 
collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support 
the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs. 
5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL 
The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including 
small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages 
and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention 
and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes 
special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout 
the state. 
5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT 
The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment 
Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide 
and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California in local 
communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce, 
veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to 
job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention, 
earnings, and occupational skills of participants. 
5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS 
The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as the National Emergency Grant Program, 
consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers due 
to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to 
react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6070 - PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD 
The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) itself is composed of five members appointed to five-year terms by the 
Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. In addition to the overall responsibility for administering the various public 
sector collective bargaining laws, the Board itself acts as an appellate body to hear challenges to proposed decisions and 
dismissals of unfair practice charges that are issued by staff. Any appeal related to the representation process is also heard by 
the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial courts. 
The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to: 
• Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively 
represent them in their labor relations with their employer. 
• Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees, 
and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws. 
LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
2019-20 STATE BUDGET — LWD 23
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
• Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings. 
• Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it 
administers. 
OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL 
The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for managing the investigation and resolution of unfair practice charges and 
presiding over informal settlement conferences. The Office of the General Counsel also oversees the statutory process through 
which employees come to form a bargaining unit and select an organization to represent them in their labor relations with their 
employer. Additionally, this section defends PERB decisions in court, seeks appropriate injunctive relief, and obtains 
enforcement when a party does not comply with final Board decisions. 
DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW 
The Division of Administrative Law conducts adjudicative proceedings, which includes the presentation of evidence and 
examination of witnesses under oath. Proposed decisions are issued consisting of written findings of fact and legal conclusions. 
STATE MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE 
The State Mediation and Conciliation Service was established in 1947 to promote harmonious labor/management relations in 
California and became a division of PERB on July 1, 2012. The division mediates labor disputes between employers and 
employee organizations and conducts consent elections. In addition, the division provides lists of arbitrators, workplace conflict 
resolution mediation, and interest-based bargaining training/facilitation services. 
DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATION 
The Division of Administration supports operations by facilitating and managing the budget, human resources management, 
business services, procurement and contracting, fiscal accountability, information technology infrastructure, and other 
administrative needs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS 
This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group of 
employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is 
actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program requires that each self-insured private-
sector employer posts a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer 
defaults on its obligations.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize 
disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides 
administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits. 
The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system 
required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured 
Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and 
sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system 
designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system. 
Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical 
Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-
based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by 
identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system. 
The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers' 
compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court, 
and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process. 
6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for: (1) issuing an annual report on the state 
of the workers' compensation system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications which would 
improve the operation of the system; (2) conducting specified surveys and evaluations required by law; (3) conducting 
continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and 
occupational diseases, including making recommendations on how to improve the workers' compensation and health and 
safety program, and if it deems appropriate, conducting or contracting for studies necessary to carry out its responsibilities; (4) 
maintaining the occupational safety and health training and education program and funding an insurance loss control services 
coordinator; and (5) issuing, if necessary, a report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of the notices 
required to be provided by insurers and self-insured employers. 
6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 
The objectives of this program include the promotion and enforcement of measures to protect the health and safety of workers 
on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels for the 
benefit of the general public. These objectives are accomplished by the coordinated efforts of the Division of Occupational 
Safety and Health (DOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational 
Safety and Health Appeals Board (Cal/OSHA Appeals Board). 
DOSH enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries, and 
helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. DOSH conducts inspections of, and issues permits to 
operate, elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels. The 
inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these 
devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, DOSH also obtains and maintains job safety records, 
reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and provides 
accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by state and 
local government. 
The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as 
follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor, 
one member from the field of occupational health, and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in 
the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards 
enforced by DOSH. 
The Cal/OSHA Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations 
and accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by DOSH for violations of occupational safety and health standards. It is 
comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, one member from 
the field of management, and one member from the field of labor. 
6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT 
The objectives of this program include: (1) interpretation and enforcement of sections of the Labor Code which relate to wages, 
hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees engaged in protected 
activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders (as applicable); (2) determination and collection 
of unpaid wages; 3) the licensing of farm labor contractors, industrial homework firms, and talent agencies; the certification of 
studio teachers; the registration of garment manufacturers, car washing and polishing businesses, and entities and individuals 
using minors in door-to-door sales; and permitting for both the employment of minors in the entertainment industry and the 
individuals representing or providing services to minors in the entertainment industry; (4) field enforcement of laws governing 
public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed contractors, rules governing meals and rest periods, the

payment of overtime and minimum wage, the licensing of specific industries, and the payment of wages without required 
deductions; (5) under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, vigorous and targeted enforcement in partnership with 
state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the "underground economy" and administration of 
the prevailing wage program, to determine and publish prevailing wage rates for public works projects; (6) enforcement of 
apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works projects; and (7) management of the Electrician Certification 
Program that tests for the minimum standards for competency and training for electricians in California. 
6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS 
The objectives of this program are to promote, develop, and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs and to 
provide consultation services to program sponsors. The Division's goal is to match the needs of workers with those of 
employers, and to strengthen the apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting 
workers and teaching the skills they and their employers need. 
The Division administers the apprenticeship system in California. This includes initial program approval and subsequent 
oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs 
and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. 
The California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the 
general policy under which this program operates. 
6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES 
The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers' 
compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required 
under the Labor Code. 
The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor 
Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be 
disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
