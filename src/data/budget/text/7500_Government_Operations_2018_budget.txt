revenues are deposited into the Regional Railroad Accident Preparedness and Immediate Response Fund. Fees are collected
on the top 25 most hazardous material commodities transported by rail car within California. The fee provides funding to pay for
the planning, developing, support, and maintenance of various aspects of regional, state, and local emergency response
programs, teams, specialized equipment, supplies, and training to prepare for such an occurrence.
6275700 - LEAD-ACID BATTERY RECYCLING FEE PROGRAM
This program provides revenue to the Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund. The fee provides funding for investigation, site
evaluation, cleanup, remediation, removal, monitoring, and other response actions for areas contaminated due to lead-acid
battery recycling facility operations, as well as refund payments, loan repayments, and administrative costs. Lead-acid battery
manufacturers and consumers are subject to the fees. The CDTFA administers the program in partnership with the California
Department of Toxic Substances Control. This program creates the California Battery Fee and the Manufacturer Battery Fee.
6275725 - CANNABIS TAXES PROGRAM
This program created two types of cannabis taxes, a cannabis excise tax and a cultivation tax. The program provides revenue
for the California Cannabis Control Fund. The program objective is to establish a special trust fund solely to carry out the
purpose of the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA). The purpose of MAUCRSA is to
establish a comprehensive system to control and regulate the cultivation, distribution, transport, storage, manufacturing,
processing, and sale of all cannabis and cannabis products. The cannabis taxes provide funding for youth education and
prevention programs, medical research, environmental mitigation efforts, law enforcement, and administration costs for
numerous state agencies charged with licensing, regulating, and taxing the cultivation and sale of cannabis.
9900 - ADMINISTRATION
The Administration program provides leadership, legal, planning, policy, research, communication, internal audit, equal
employment opportunity, and other essential services necessary to support the Department's programmatic goals and
objectives. This support includes central administrative services in accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety,
human resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting. This program also provides
administrative and personnel services for the Board of Equalization.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6280 - TAX PROGRAMS
This program administers the Revenue and Taxation Code by reasonably interpreting and impartially applying the legislatively

compliance with disclosures and record keeping requirements. On behalf of the Fair Political Practices Commission, and in
compliance with the Political Reform Act of 1974, the Franchise Tax Board conducts randomly selected field audits of
committees supporting and opposing political candidates and statewide measures, as well as any state or county central
committee or independent committee that spends $10,000 or more.

6295 - COURT COLLECTION PROGRAM
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent fines, penalties, and orders imposed by, and on behalf of,
superior, municipal, and justice courts by utilizing the same automated collection capabilities that are used to collect the

Department of General Services
The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides
centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and
construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building;
printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's
vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve
California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions.
Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support
this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES
With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for
inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in
public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds
are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public
building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school

districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e)
Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California.
6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION
The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and
equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties.
6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES
Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid
redundancy, and deliver property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate space
for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Assuring protection of lives and property
in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified parties
(both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their programs to
the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies, and providing
public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and ensuring
equitable treatment of private property owners.
6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES
To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are
basic to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include procurement of green and sustainable materials,
energy/natural gas, and transportation; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support
requirements include travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide
sustainability, energy efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and human
resources services. Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative judges to conduct quasi-
judicial hearings and mediations authorized by law.
9900 - ADMINISTRATION
The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This
program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services,
auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative
services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, labor relations, information technology, health
and safety, procurement, and contracting.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION
This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer
financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a
claim with the CalVCB for program benefits.

(the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition
and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,
the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities.
6390 - GOVERNMENT CLAIMS
This program receives, investigates, and processes claims for money or damages filed against the state.
6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN
This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that
benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
The Budget includes an increase to the state's pension contribution due to the CalPERS Board's action in 2016 to lower the
assumed rate of return for the system. The assumption change increased the system's liabilities, resulting in an increase to
the state's funding obligation. The reduction in the assumed rate of return, from 7.5 to 7 percent, is being phased in over
three years; this is the second year of the phase-in.
•
The Budget also includes $623.5 million within the Proposition 2 debt payment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s
portion of a loan from the Surplus Money Investment Fund. This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension
payment to CalPERS in 2017-18. The payment was made to mitigate the increase in state contributions due to the lower
assumed rate of return, as described above, and has been apportioned accordingly to the five state retirement plans based
on the unfunded liability of each plan.

Administration at its May 2018 meeting.  The increase to this estimate from the 2018-19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act is 
primarily due to an increase in salary and benefits.

2/ The 2018 Budget Act estimates 2018-19 state contributions to CalPERS to be $6,189,583,000.  The reduction in this estimate from the 
2018-19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act reflects a decrease in the five state plans' employer contribution rates, with the exception 
of the state safety plan, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2018 meeting.
4/ The 2018 Budget Act estimates 2018-19 other expenditures to be $860,430,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at 
its May 2018 meeting.  The net decrease to this estimate from the 2018-19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act is primarily due to an 
increase in investment operating costs and a decrease in investment external management fees.

(California Employers' Retiree Benefit Trust)
3/ Pursuant to Chapter 2, Statutes of 2016 (Assembly Bill 133), the 2015 Budget Act included a one-time allocation of $240 million to 
pay down the state's unfunded liability for retiree health care.  This amount was apportioned to the trust fund accounts of bargaining 
units that had reached a memorandum of understanding with the Administration by November 1, 2016, and where such agreement 
included employer and employee contributions for prefunding retiree health care.  Pursuant to the requirements of AB 133, the $240 
million appropriation was apportioned to the following subaccounts in 2016-17: $9,856,000 to BU2, $37,760,000 to BU5, 
$123,752,000 to BU6, $25,303,000 to BU7, $35,210,000 to BU 9, and $8,119,000 to BU10.
4/ Per Government Code Section 22940, assets accumulated in state bargaining unit subaccounts within the Annuitant’s Health Care 
Coverage Fund will not be expended until the individual subaccount reaches a 100 percent funded ratio as determined by an actuarial 
valuation, or until July 1, 2046.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6410 - RETIREMENT
CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for
employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of
duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2017, there were about 1,257,000 active and inactive members, and
about 668,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system.
Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation.
There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter,
California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract
with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit
formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions.
As of June 30, 2017, there were 2,945 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and
survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their
careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency
retirement systems.
CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems.
6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS
The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee
associations, and others to provide health and long-term care insurance for state, California State University, and local public
agency employees, retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-
effective programs, provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee
organizations and employer representatives.
Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic,
Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all
eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial
intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes.
6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS
Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the
purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired
members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees'
Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $326.4 billion, as of June 30, 2017.
6425 - ADMINISTRATION
This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of
the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy
Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Operational
Support, and Public Affairs.

Office of Administrative Law
The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state
regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these
regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also
responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been
recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through
a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative
Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members
of the public regarding California rulemaking law.
In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies
constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations.
The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the
California Regulatory Notice Register.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
The Budget includes $3.1 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. This roughly $300 million year-over-year
increase is due to an unanticipated increase in payroll growth, and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its
authority to increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law
in 2014. The Teachers' Retirement Board adopted changes in demographic and economic assumptions in 2017, which
resulted in an increase to the system's liabilities, thereby increasing the state's funding obligation.
•
The Budget also includes $3.4 million and 14 positions to increase internal investment management to achieve CalSTRS'
investment objectives more effectively. The funding and positions in 2018-19 are the first step of a five-year phase in of
$15.4 million in permanent funding and 58 positions.

1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2018-19 Governor's Budget.
2/ The 2018 Budget Act reflects 2018-19 state contributions to CalSTRS to be $3,082,316,000.  The increase in this amount from the 2018-
19 Governor's Budget to the 2018 Budget Act is due to an increase in reported creditable compensation.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS
CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the
distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the
largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement
benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may
modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the
member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's
retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or
contract provisions.
Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the
General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of
administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
