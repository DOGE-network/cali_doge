Environmental 
Protection 
California Environmental Protection Agency 
programs reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
restore and protect environmental quality, and 
protect public health. The Secretary coordinates 
the state's environmental regulatory programs and 
ensures fair and consistent enforcement of 
environmental law, which safeguards the state's 
residents and promotes the state's economic 
vitality. 
3900   Air Resources Board 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air 
pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for 
Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40 
percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 
32). The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's 
most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with air 
pollution control distrcts, the business community, scientists, community representatives and other stakeholders to implement 
all of its programs. 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Air Resources Board has 58 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 57 sites are occupied through 
lease, permit, or license agreements. Of the non state-owned sites, 35 support air-monitoring stations and 22 sites support an 
array of vehicle testing, research, planning, enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs; 
some of the support sites are also equipped with an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air 
Resources Board oversees to support its statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's 
exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air 
Resources Board leadership role related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Exide Cleanup—The Budget includes $59.6 million General Fund on a one-time basis to accelerate the cleanup of additional 
properties within a 1.7-mile radius of the closed Exide battery recycling facility over the next two years and complete cleanup 
activities already initiated where costs have exceeded estimates due to unforeseen cleanup-related activities. This funding 
will allow the Department to cleanup approximately 700 additional high-risk properties with high concentrations of lead in soil 
and the greatest potential for exposure. The state continues to pursue cost recovery from Exide to reimburse the state for 
these costs. 
• Base Funding to Maintain Operations—The Budget includes $27.5 million General Fund on a one-time basis to backfill the 
Hazardous Waste Control Account and eliminates the annual $16.7 million Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund’s General Fund 
Loan repayment. This funding and elimination of the General Fund loan repayment will prevent the Hazardous Waste 
Control Account and Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund from experiencing deficits in the budget year and allow the 
Department to maintain current service levels.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM 
The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund 
program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,170 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups, 
and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 470 sites where the cleanup process is complete. 
Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 820 land-use restrictions in 
place on properties throughout the state. 
New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other 
previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to 
return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties, 
abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military 
installations. 
The program oversees environmental assessments and the cleanup of proposed new or expanding school sites to prevent or 
reduce exposing students and staff to hazardous substances. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous 
Waste Site, a former hazardous waste disposal site and federal Superfund Site. 
The program works closely with other state agencies, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and local agencies 
throughout the state to establish and implement viable grant and loan programs to aid in the assessment and cleanup of 
brownfields sites. 
The program works with the California Emergency Management Agency and other state agencies to assure response 
readiness for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous 
waste spills and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories. 
3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT 
The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of 
hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at 
119 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous 
waste, and approximately 300 facilities/generators that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages 
approximately $2.2 billion in financial assurance resources, and supports and oversees local agencies implementing the 
hazardous waste elements of the Unified Program. 
The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including 
electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste 
requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused 
enforcement initiatives. The program also ensures compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste 
and used oil. 
3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS 
The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program strives to get manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to 
toxic chemicals. SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products and use pollution prevention best practices. The 
program implements the SCP regulations. SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order 
to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the 
analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption 
of "green chemistry" practices. 
Pollution Prevention responsibilities are to promote compliance with legislative mandates regarding consumer product chemical 
safety. The program supports adoption of focused business sector pollution prevention strategies; supports local green 
business initiatives; and helps the regulated community comply with laws and regulations. 
This program, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, 
also implements the California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program. The Department's Environmental 
Chemistry Laboratory (ECL) is charged with measuring both targeted and new chemicals in blood and urine. Ongoing activities

3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued
2019-20 STATE BUDGET — EP 55
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
include measuring these chemicals in studies of vulnerable populations, including mothers and their newborns, older women, 
firefighters, and families with childhood leukemia. Additionally, ECL is continuously developing new methods to identify and 
measure chemicals of emerging concern, including newer flame retardants and other substitutes and alternatives for restricted/
banned toxic chemicals. The SCP program will rely on biomonitoring results for implementation of its three-year Priority 
Products Work Plan. Biomonitoring evidence has been identified in the Work Plan as a priority screening tool for identification 
of product-chemical combinations warranting consideration of safer alternatives. 
3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY 
The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) 
in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the Department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified 
Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for 
owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response 
plans and inventories; California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements 
pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories. 
3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM 
The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees the removal and remedial actions in the 
communities surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the program, 
the Department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including residences, schools, daycare 
centers, and parks within a 1.7 mile radius of the facility. The program will cleanup contaminated soil at those properties with 
the highest levels and greatest potential for exposure. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce management, 
information management, and business services. The program also provides legal counsel, external communication, analytical 
chemistry support, environmental justice and tribal affairs consultation, and public participation services.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3700 - Waste Reduction and Management 
The objectives of the Waste Reduction and Management Program include: 
• Ensuring all nonhazardous solid waste is stored, collected, processed, and disposed in a safe and environmentally sound 
manner. 
• Participating in development and maintenance of local solid waste management plans describing how each city and county 
will reduce solid waste disposed to achieve at minimum a 50 percent diversion of waste from landfills.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
• Developing programs and policies to support the goal that not less than 75 percent of solid waste generated be source 
reduced, recycled, or composted by the year 2020 . 
• Reducing the disposal of organic material through recycling and compositing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
• Cleaning up solid waste disposal sites when the responsible party either cannot be identified or is unable or unwilling to pay 
for timely remediation, and where cleanup is needed to protect public health and safety, or the environment. 
• Developing and promoting waste reduction strategies through reuse, upcycling, and source reduction. 
• Promoting the use of recycled materials in California manufacturing. 
• Reducing the number of tires placed in landfills, illegally dumped, or stockpiled while promoting technologies turning waste 
tires into useful products. 
• Reducing the amount of improperly disposed used oil and promoting used oil recycling. 
• Reducing electronic waste by providing safe and convenient collection and recycling of specified electronic equipment. 
3710 - Education and the Environment Initiative 
In cooperation with the State Department of Education and the State Board of Education, the Office of Education and the 
Environment develops and implements a unified education strategy for educating pupils, faculty, and administrators on the 
importance of integrating environmental concepts and principles for elementary and secondary schools. The EEI vision 
encourages responsible stewardship of the Earth, advances tomorrow's leaders in a changing economy, and positively impacts 
the lives of students, families, schools, communities, and California. 
3715 - Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction 
CalRecycle administers the Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction program with a goal of achieving an 80-percent 
recycling rate for glass, aluminum, and plastic beverage containers sold in California. To achieve this goal, the Division of 
Recycling ensures the following: (1) the California Redemption Value (CRV) is paid by beverage distributors for each beverage 
sold in California; (2) consumers are refunded CRV for recycled beverage containers; (3) recycling centers are conveniently 
located; (4) grants are made to encourage recycling and development of markets for recycled materials; (5) strong oversight 
and enforcement programs are in place to protect the integrity of the Beverage Container Recycling Fund; and (6) public 
outreach and private partnerships are promoted.

3980   Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment 
The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances the health of Californians and the state's 
environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office 
performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as 
other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with the scientific tools and information upon which to base risk 
management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing health risks, including risks to children and other sensitive 
subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, hazardous and 
municipal waste facilities, fish and shellfish, and sediments in bay and estuarine waters. The Office also evaluates community 
pollution burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3730 - HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT 
The Health Risk Assessment program conducts scientific assessments of health and environmental risks of chemicals that 
enter the environment from many different sources. The program identifies chemicals with potential to cause adverse health 
effects; quantifies risks and recommends health-based goals and standards; develops scientific policies and guidelines for 
hazard identification and risk assessment; and provides medical, scientific, and public health support, consultation, and training 
to state regulators, local governmental agencies, and the public. The program also evaluates community pollution burdens and 
vulnerabilities. This program pays particular attention to protecting the health of infants and children.
