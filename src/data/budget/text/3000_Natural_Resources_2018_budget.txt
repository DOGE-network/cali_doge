Natural
Resources
Natural Resources Agency programs protect and
restore California's diverse natural and cultural
resources for current and future generations,
including operating state parks, managing water
supplies, supporting forest health, encouraging
clean energy, and preserving fish and wildlife
habitats, rich farmlands and mineral resources.
Agency programs also protect the public through
suppression of wildfires and construction of levees
in the Central Valley. These programs not only
contribute to the state's unique quality of life, but
also are critical to sustaining a vibrant economy.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
2300 - EDUCATION
Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the Science Center-Education represents one of California's premier educational and
family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops
and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs.
Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological
processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,
communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its temporary
home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center - its
permanent home - is completed.
In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The
Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and
other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a
Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The
school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards.
The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those
traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding
support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.

California Tahoe Conservancy
The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the extraordinary natural and
recreational resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing
programs that acquire environmentally sensitive land, provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed
restoration, improve stream environments and wildlife habitats, and improve water quality. The Conservancy also balances
these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by
acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.
The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) which is a 1997
agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and
various private entities to commit $908 million over 10 years to a list of acquisition and capital improvement projects needed to
achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. The 2008-2018 EIP was finalized in July 2009.
Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program
to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY
The California Tahoe Conservancy performs day-to-day management and maintenance of the lands it has acquired, as well as
the completion of corrective and restorative actions needed to fully achieve the purposes of the acquisitions. It is envisioned
that the Conservancy will acquire up to 6,000 environmentally sensitive parcels under existing criteria. To date, nearly 4,900
parcels, totaling nearly 6,500 acres, have been acquired. These parcels are being managed to maintain and/or restore their
natural functions, provide for public safety, and provide for open spaces.
The Conservancy has also acquired additional parcels where more extensive site improvements or more active ultimate uses
are envisioned. For example, the management objectives for the public access and recreation lands are to allow for: suitable
and appropriate interim uses during the site improvement planning and implementation process, design and construction of
public access facilities, and long-term management.
In addition, high rates of tree mortality (25 - 40 percent) throughout the Basin have required special emphasis on forest
resource management activities to reduce fuel hazards, remove hazardous conditions, start corrective actions to manage forest
health through a variety of means, and limit public liability. Activities include the removal of diseased, dead and dying trees to
promote forest health while reducing the risk of fire that would destroy property and habitat, threaten lives, and diminish the
water quality and other resource values of Lake Tahoe.
The program also provides grants to local governments to improve the Lake's water quality by controlling soil erosion caused
by existing development, primarily along roadways, and to treat sediment-laden runoff. These projects involve acquisitions and
site improvements such as the revegetation of barren slopes, and building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment
basins.
2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS
This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing
facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide

The California Tahoe Conservancy manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife habitat,
watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary implementer
of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake Tahoe Basin - a
1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local
governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

California Conservation Corps
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires,
floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at
public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become
strong workers and citizens.
In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that
are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities.
Because CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support
this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
2360 - TRAINING AND WORK PROGRAM
This Program focuses on four areas:
Natural Resource Work: Corpsmembers protect and enhance the state's natural resources through park development, trail
construction, tree planting, fire hazard reduction, watershed improvement, wildlife habitat enhancement, removal of non-native
vegetation, meadow restoration, energy and water auditing and retrofitting, irrigation system installation, and drought-tolerant
and other landscaping.
Disaster Response: Corpsmembers are dispatched to fires, assisting with initial attack, mop-up and logistical support; floods,
filling sandbags, reinforcing levees and stabilizing hillsides; earthquakes, removing hazards and staffing disaster assistance
centers; oil spill clean-up; snow removal; search and rescue operations; pest infestation eradication; and homeland security
assistance.
Corpsmember Education: Corpsmembers are provided opportunities to advance their academic skills while in the CCC through
local adult and charter schools and community colleges.
Corpsmember Development and Training: The CCC stresses the development of both a work and service ethic, which includes
teamwork, self-discipline, leadership, and giving back to California. Corpsmembers learn conservation principles and career
planning. The CCC also offers training in trail building, first aid, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, and
firefighting certification, which can lead to internship opportunities with various employers in California.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 8 residential and 18 non-residential
facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities help the CCC achieve its mission of providing employment, training, and
educational opportunities to young men and women, and assisting federal, state and local agencies, and nonprofit entities with
the conservation of California's natural resources.
The CCC residential facilities house 80-100 corpsmembers and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people together from
across the state, increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential centers range in size
from 30-60 corpsmembers and allow young people with families to live at home and report to work.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION
This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides,
tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and
the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal,
state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about
land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.
2425 - OIL, GAS, AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES
This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to protect the
environment, prevent pollution, and ensure public safety. The state is fully reimbursed for program expenditures by annual
assessments and fees on the respective industries. Approximately 450 companies operate over 88,000 wells in California for
the production of oil, natural gas, and geothermal resources.
2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION
This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. Under the Land Conservation
Act, landowners who agree to keep their property undeveloped for at least ten years receive lower property tax assessments.
The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts for the
acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development rights, and therefore development
pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program within the Land Resource Protection
Program develops maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to
assist in local land use decisions.
2435 - MINE RECLAMATION
This program regulates active surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to
reclaim mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned
mines and remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.
2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD
The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of
mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The Department's California Geological Survey and the Office of Mine
Reclamation provide the engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for the reports, plans, and maps which the
Board approves. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notices of violations
or orders to comply, and disputes with local lead agencies.

Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the
property and resources of California.
CAL FIRE provides all hazard emergency - fire, medical, rescue and disaster - response to the public and provides leadership
in the protection of life, property and natural resources.
CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety
programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information & education; resource protection; and emergency response.
CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing
diverse yet complementary efforts including: training California's fire service professionals; public education and prevention
awareness; responsible stewardship of our natural resources; and natural resource and emergency management.
CAL FIRE's highly trained professionals and leaders cultivate mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels
of government and the private sector to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate
emergencies in the urban, rural, and wild land areas of California.
CAL FIRE promotes a culture of innovation, accountability, integrity, diversity, planning, workplace safety, and teamwork to
foster an efficient and effective organizational environment.
Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
Helicopter Procurement—The Budget includes $101.2 million General Fund to support replacement of the CAL FIRE’s fleet
of Vietnam War-era helicopters. This funding will begin a multi-year effort to fully replace the Department’s aging fleet with
new modern helicopters. These new helicopters will have enhanced firefighting capabilities, including the ability to fly at
night, which will improve CAL FIRE's ability to respond to the increasing number and severity of wildfires resulting from
climate change.
•
Climate Change Fire Severity—The Budget includes $10.9 million General Fund to provide heavy equipment mechanics,
vehicle maintenance funding, and associated administrative support staff to address the nearly year-round fire season.
These resources build on the funding provided for additional year-round fire engines and extended fire season staffing in the
2017 Budget Act and reflect the Administration’s continued efforts to meet the demands of longer, more severe fire seasons
driven by climate change.
•
McClellan Reload Base—The Budget includes $4 million General Fund for six permanent positions and 6.1 seasonal
positions to staff and operate the McClellan Reload Base for the rapid deployment of large air tankers and the California
National Guard Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems.
•
Fire Training Center—The Budget includes $26.6 million General Fund for CAL FIRE, the California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation, and the California Conservation Corps to operate the Firefighter Training and Certification
Program for ex-offenders. The 18-month program will enable 80 ex-offenders, as well as 20 corpsmembers, to gain the
training and experience needed to qualify for entry-level firefighting positions with local, state, and federal firefighting
agencies.
•
Healthy and Resilient Forests—The Budget includes $160 million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and 19 positions to
support forest health programs that will reduce emissions from wildfires and tree mortality and increase carbon stored in
living trees in order to maintain California's forests and meet 2030 carbon goals.
•
Prescribed Fire and Fuel Reduction—The Budget includes $30.8 million to implement recommendations of the
Administration's California Forest Carbon Plan. This includes $30 million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and 79 positions

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
2460 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL
The Office of the State Fire Marshal is moving to Program 2461. See description below.
2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL
The Office of the State Fire Marshal is responsible for the statewide protection of life and property through the development
and application of fire protection engineering, education and enforcement.
2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) includes the following activities:
•
Code Development and Analysis: Objectives include the development and adoption of codes relating to fire/life safety used
statewide by local fire and building authorities. The Code Development and Analysis Division fosters, promotes and develops
ways and means of protecting life and property against fire in many ways, including the adoption and implementation of
regulations for statewide application. This division prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations and building standards
for review and adoption into the California Code of Regulations, Titles 19 and 24. The division assists with the application of
state laws, regulations, and code enforcement relating by a city, county, fire departments or fire districts, and building
departments. This division also reviews all of California's regulations relating to fire and life safety for relevancy, necessity,
conflict, duplication and/or overlap.
•
Fire and Life Safety: This program is the main entity within the department for the application of laws and regulations related
to fire prevention and life safety. This is achieved through code compliance inspections of new and existing buildings and
plan review and construction inspections of state-owned and state-occupied projects. The OSFM is responsible for fire & life
safety in over 45,000 state-owned and state-occupied facilities, which include: state prisons, conservation camps, community
correctional facilities, state mental hospitals, state developmental centers, California State University and University of
California campuses, and California Agricultural Districts.
•
Fire Engineering and Arson and Bomb: The Fire Engineering Division administers licensing programs and provides services
for product evaluation, certifications and listings. This division also oversees the Arson and Bomb Unit, which has the
responsibility to dispose seized illegal fireworks and conduct fire/explosion investigations and licensing enforcement. The
division is responsible for 11 statewide programs, which include the Building Materials Listing; Portable Fire Extinguishers;
Flame Retardant Chemicals and Fabrics; Vapor Recovery; Automatic Fire Extinguishing Systems; Fire Safe Cigarettes;
Licensing Enforcement and Inspection; Lab Accreditation; Fireworks; and Motion Picture and Entertainment, Arson and
Bomb Investigation and Fireworks Disposal. This division's primary functions are licensing, product approval, fire/explosion
investigations and licensing enforcement.
•
Pipeline Safety: This program regulates approximately 4,800 miles of intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines that transport
crude oil and refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc.) between offshore platforms, production fields, refineries
and marine terminals. Regulated pipelines do not include those within production fields, marine terminals or refineries.
•
State Fire Training: This program administers the California Fire Service Training and Education System and the Fire Service
Training and Education Program for federal, state and local firefighters. The program oversees a California Fire Academy
System for over 50 training academies that represent a partnership with the fire departments, community colleges and the
OSFM. State Fire Training administers a professional certification system for firefighters and chief officers and receives
program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services.
2461019 - California Underground Facilities Safe Excavation Board:
The Board, created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661), works on issues related to the State's "Call
Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators, except in the case of an emergency, to contact a regional notification center,
as specified.

2018-19 STATE BUDGET — RES 71
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
2465 - FIRE PROTECTION
CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property and natural resources within social, political and economic
constraints. The objective is to quickly and aggressively attack all fires in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct
protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial attack and
follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires within the first
burning period.
2465010 - Fire Prevention:
This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression
cost recovery and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials and procedures to
mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to be
done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of fire fighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire fighters
and damage to the environment.
2465019 - Fire Control:
The objective of this program is to detect, respond and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility Area.
The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 10
acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews,
bulldozers, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.
2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection:
CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state and federal agencies throughout California
through the administration of over 100 cooperative government agreements. Additionally, there are six long standing
agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department.
2465037 - Conservation Camps:
CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Operations and Juvenile
Justice, operates 39 conservation camps throughout the state that house 196 fire crews. These crews provide one of the
primary labor forces for firefighting, emergency response, and conservation related work projects.
2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression:
CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope
with a wildland fire within the initial attack period. Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was
incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of
this cost through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes.
2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands and urban forests provide multiple human, climate and
environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to
these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting,
coordination of climate related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial landowners, operation of
state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects and administration of federal
forestry assistance programs.
2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement:
The objective of this program is to improve forest lands and urban forests. Activities include the detection, evaluation and
control of forest pests; growing and selling tree seedlings for reforestation, carbon sequestration, and soil erosion control;
maintenance of a native conifer seed bank; advice and assistance to non-industrial forest landowners on management of
forests and improved harvesting and conservation practices; research on and demonstration of sustainable forestry in state
forests; implementation of the California Forest Improvement Act of 1978; technical assistance and grants to foster the
environmental, social, and economic benefits of urban forests consistent with the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978; and
purchase and monitoring of working forest conservation easements per the California Forest Legacy Act of 2008. In the area of
vegetation management, assistance is provided to public and private landowners to achieve land use objectives by reducing
damage from wildland fires, increase wildlife habitat, increase productivity of forest and rangelands, improve water yields and
air quality, reduce carbon emissions from wildland fires, increase firefighter safety, and maintain desirable ecosystems. CAL
FIRE cooperates with federal, state and local agencies, local organizations, and private property owners to develop and
achieve land use objectives. Activities include removal, rearrangement, conversion, or improvement of vegetation using various
treatment measures such as prescribed fire and mechanical, manual, and biological methods. The Environmental Protection

Program provides in-house expertise and oversight of the Department's compliance with the California Environmental Quality
Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws and regulations applicable to departmental actions.
2470019 - Forest Practice Regulations:
The objective of this program is to maximize sustained production of high-quality timber products while protecting soil, water,
wildlife, recreation and other values associated with forest land. Forest Practice activities include the review and permitting of
commercial timber harvesting operations on nonfederal timberlands, enforcing state forest practice laws and regulations, and
monitoring compliance and the effects of timber operations on forest productivity, water quality, watersheds, soils, botanical
resources, wildlife, fisheries, greenhouse gases and other environmentally sensitive resources. The Program is also
responsible for issuing licenses to timber operators (LTOs), providing LTO training and education, and assisting the Board of
Equalization-Timber Tax Division in their administration of taxes on timber and timberland. Forest Practice Program staff also
assist the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, and facilitate and participate in monitoring the effectiveness of the Board's
forest practice regulations.
2470028 - Forest Resource Inventory and Assessment:
The objective of this program is to perform a periodic assessment of California's forest and rangeland resources. Activities
include maintaining and distributing mission-critical datasets for fire planning, emergency incident support and meeting certain
regulatory requirements. In addition, the program provides extensive technical and public information for statewide fire threat,
fire hazard, watersheds, socio-economic conditions, environmental indicators and urban forestry.
2470037 - Professional Foresters Registration Program:
The Office of Professional Foresters Registration is a statutorily authorized program within the State Board of Forestry and Fire
Protection. The program is responsible for the licensing and regulation of all persons who practice forestry or rangeland
management on non-federal, state and private lands in California pursuant to the Professional Foresters Law of 1972.
2475 - BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION
The California State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection (Board) is a Governor-appointed body within CAL FIRE. The Board
is responsible for developing the general forest policy of the state, for determining the guidance policies of CAL FIRE, and for
representing the state's interest in Federal land in California. Together, the Board and CAL FIRE work to carry out the California
Legislature's mandate to protect and enhance the State's unique forest and wildland resources. The Board's statutory

State Lands Commission
The California State Lands Commission serves the people of California by providing stewardship of the lands, waterways, and
resources entrusted to its care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the
promotion of public access. Diligent execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in
the generation of over $11 billion in revenues while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy those lands and
resources.
Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands
Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing California's sovereign public trust lands and resources,
which the state received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands subsequently conveyed to the
state by the federal government (commonly known as "school" lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands
legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage development and use of the state's tidelands
consistent with the public trust doctrine, and typically require grantees to reinvest revenues produced from the granted lands
back into the trust.
Public trust or "sovereign" lands include the beds of all natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and
lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays and the Pacific Ocean extending from the mean high tide
line seaward to the three-mile offshore limit and totaling over four and one-half million acres. In addition to sovereign lands, the
Commission manages "school" lands, which were granted to California by the federal government under the Act of March 3,
1853 (10 Stat. 244) for the purpose of supporting public education in California. School lands include the 16th and 36th
sections of each township (with the exception of lands already reserved for public use or previously taken by private claims)
and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state,
only about 460,370 acres remain in state ownership and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The
Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
The State Lands Commission oversees efficient and safe development of mineral resources that are located on state lands.
The State also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oils fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the
safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,
geothermal resources and other minerals; collect revenues generated consistent with the best interests of the state, and ensure
that public safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these
resources through engineering review, marine facility inspections, and safety audits. The Commission also adopts regulations
for the prevention of oil spills, the safe operation of offshore facilities and program and financial audits to ensure the state
receives fair value for the development of its resources.
2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT
The State Lands Commission manages all ungranted state sovereign lands consistent with the common law public trust
doctrine and prudent land use and management practices. The Commission issues leases and permits for the use and

occupation of public trust lands under its jurisdiction based upon environmental, economic, health, safety and public benefit
considerations. The program also manages all state school lands to ensure the greatest economic return to the State Teachers'
Retirement System. The Commission also oversees the administration of public trust lands legislatively granted to local
jurisdictions to manage on behalf of the State, including the major ports in the State.
2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROGRAM
The State Lands Commission adopts rules, regulations, and guidelines for marine oil terminals within California, providing the
best achievable protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Commission's Marine Environmental
Protection Program monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, inspects all marine facilities and reviews, and approves all
marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification programs . The Program also administers Chapter 31F of
the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit for purpose. In addition, the Marine Environmental
Protection Program implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous
species into California waters through vessel mediated vectors. The program funds and conducts scientific research, develops
rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing vessels to assess
compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions.
9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION
The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction and administrative support to the line
programs of the Commission.

Department of Fish and Wildlife
The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the
habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public.
This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to ensure the survival of all species and
natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational,
commercial, scientific, and educational uses.
Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure
Overview."

•
Sustainable Funding for Fish and Wildlife—$31.6 million ($26.6 million General Fund and $5 million California Tire Recycling
Management Fund) to (1) continue the current level of service for core fish and wildlife program; (2) augment high-priority
programs that are consistent with the priorities identified in the most recent update to the Strategic Vision report; and (3) to
initiate an independent service-based budget review and develop a tracking system to support an analysis of the
Department’s existing revenue structure and program activities. The service-based budget review, which will be completed
by 2021, is based on a similar service-based budget review performed for the Department of Parks and Recreation and will
provide an objective foundation for future budget decision-making.

Department of Fish and Wildlife - Continued
2018-19 STATE BUDGET — RES 99
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
This program facilitates diverse and sustainable hunting, fishing (recreational and commercial), trapping, and other public uses
and associated economic benefits to the state by conserving and managing game species. Activities include collection and
assessment of information on the distribution and abundance of game fish and wildlife to determine appropriate regulations
(bag limits, gear restrictions, etc.) and to monitor the effects of those regulations.
2600 - MANAGEMENT OF DEPARTMENT LANDS AND FACILITIES PROGRAM
This program manages Department-owned or leased lands and facilities, including hatcheries, wildlife areas, ecological
reserves, fish and wildlife laboratories, and public access areas, to contribute to the conservation, protection, and management
of fish and wildlife.
2605 - ENFORCEMENT
This program serves the public through law enforcement, public safety and hunter education. Law enforcement promotes
compliance with laws and regulations protecting fish and wildlife resources; investigates habitat destruction, pollution incidents
and illegal commercialization of wildlife. Wardens also serve the public through general law enforcement, mutual aid and
homeland security.
2610 - COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH PROGRAM
This program serves the public through resource conservation education and use activities in the classroom and on public and
private lands, community and stakeholder outreach, and the delivery of information and data using a variety of methods
including publications, presentations, web applications and media relations.
2615 - SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM
This program prevents damage, minimizes environmental impacts, restores, and rehabilitates California's fish and wildlife
populations and their habitats from the harmful effects of oil and other deleterious material spills in marine waters and inland
habitats.
2620 - FISH AND GAME COMMISSION
The California Fish and Game Commission ensures the long term sustainability of California's fish and wildlife resources by
guiding the ongoing scientific evaluation and assessment of California's fish and wildlife resources; setting California's fish and
wildlife resource management policies and ensuring these are implemented by the Department of Fish and Wildlife;
establishing appropriate fish and wildlife resource management rules and regulations; and building active fish and wildlife
resource management partnerships with individual landowners, the public and interest groups, and federal, state and local
resource management agencies.

California Coastal Commission
The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed equally by the Governor, the Senate Rules
Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the
California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and
recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources,
and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. New development in the coastal zone requires
a coastal permit either from local government or the Commission. Local governments are required to prepare a local coastal
program (LCP) for the coastal zone portion of their jurisdiction. After an LCP has been reviewed and approved by the
Commission as being consistent with the Coastal Act, the Commission's regulatory authority over most types of new
development is delegated to the local government, subject to limited appeals to the Commission. The Commission also is
designated the principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone
Management Act in California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal
development projects, and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be
subject to state control.

•
Increase public access to the coast and outdoor recreational opportunities by creating new parks, trails and recreational
amenities.

2805 - STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The State Coastal Conservancy provides grants and technical assistance to local governments, nonprofits and other project
partners for the acquisition of land and easements, the development of public facilities, and the restoration of habitat. The State
Coastal Conservancy helps to implement the State's federally approved Coastal Management Program and supports programs
that increase public access to the coast. The Conservancy has participated in the protection of more than 390,000 acres of
coastal lands through acquisition of fee title and conservation easements. The Conservancy has helped restore more than
33,000 acres of habitat.
Through its projects, the Conservancy has established approximately 160 new coastal accessways and built more than 168
miles of new trails.
State Coastal Conservancy funds are primarily expended for purposes of local assistance but may also be expended for capital
outlay purposes, see Program 2820.

more than 390,000 acres of coastal lands through acquisition of fee title and conservation easements. The Conservancy has
helped restore more than 33,000 acres of habitat.

Department of Parks and Recreation
The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and
education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most
valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and
future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the
major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural
resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park
visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and
water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding,
jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds,
plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing
financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies.
Because Parks' program drives a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support
this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
Fixing State Parks and Improving Access for All Californians—$42 million State Parks and Recreation Fund and 364
positions to increase services that emphasize those that directly benefit park visitors by improving access, and fixing and
maintaining the aging infrastructure of the state parks system. The largest area of investment is facilities and maintenance,
which will contribute to maintaining clean water supplies, clean restrooms, dynamic trail systems, stable historic structures,
and safe roads. These additional resources will also help address more than $1 billion in deferred maintenance projects
throughout the state parks system. The natural and cultural management funding will allow the Department to better
understand, protect, and preserve California's biologically and culturally diverse places under its care. The interpretation and
education augmentations will build upon the Department's recent focus on developing stronger relationships with the public.
The public safety positions will focus on providing a safe visitor experience in complex park environments and protecting
cultural and natural resources.
•
Solving the Structural Imbalance and Establishing a Reserve—$26.6 million in permanent funding from the State Parks and
Recreation Fund to address the structural imbalance. Since 2012, the Department has relied on one-time appropriations to
maintain services across the park system. The Budget ends that pattern and provides sustainable ongoing funding, including
$8.5 million to establish a prudent reserve balance in the Fund.
•
Fix Our Parks Investments—$3 million State Parks and Recreation Fund for the following, $1 million to make permanent the
newly established recruitment and training program for hard-to-fill classifications; $1 million for increased law enforcement,
environmental monitoring, and maintenance grants supporting federal off-highway vehicle recreation; and $1 million for the
Abandoned Watercraft Abatement grant program to remove abandoned watercraft from California's waterways.
•
State Parks System Enhancements—$4 million to begin project identification and planning activities necessary to
strategically allocate Proposition 68 funds dedicated to the state park system. Of this amount, $1.9 million will support
implementation of the Redwoods Rising project to enhance old growth coastal redwoods, in collaboration with the National
Park Service and the Save the Redwoods League.
•
Safe Neighborhood Parks—$277 million to provide grants for the creation of new parks and recreation facilities, as well as
the rehabilitation of existing local parks, in critically underserved communities throughout California, consistent with the
Statewide Park Development and Community Revitalization Program.
•
Per Capita Grants—$186 million to provide for the acquisition and development of neighborhood, community, and regional
parks and recreation lands and facilities in urban and rural areas.
•
California Indian Heritage Center—$100 million General Fund for the Department to construct a new museum to protect and
preserve the history of California’s native peoples. The total cost of the project is estimated at $200 million. The
Administration will work with stakeholders to raise the additional $100 million necessary to complete the project. This new
museum would replace the current State Indian Museum, which was built in 1940 on the grounds of Sutter’s Fort State
Historic Park. The Department would operate the museum and work with tribal representatives in developing appropriate
content for the interpretive program to engage visitors in celebrating the living cultures of California Tribes.
•
Fort Ross State Historic Park: Cultural Trail—$852,000 Proposition 12 bond funds to design a new trail focusing on
increasing the interpretive program at Fort Ross State Historic Park. The trail would complete a segment of the California
Coastal Trail and a multimedia interpretive program encouraging park visitors to explore the complex history of the site. The
interpretive program will be developed through a partnership with stakeholders including the native people of the area and
UC Berkeley. Total project costs are estimated to be $3.4 million.
•
Museum of Tolerance Renovation Project—$10 million General Fund on a one-time basis for the Department of Parks and
Recreation to provide a grant for the Museum's renovation project. This funding will provide half of the estimated $20 million
cost of the renovation to fund critical capital improvements.
•
Legacy Forests at State Parks—$15 million Proposition 68 for the Department of Parks and Recreation to protect forests in
state parks. This funding will support restoration efforts in state parks throughout the state, including coastal redwoods,
central Sierra sequoias, coastal pines, and oak woodlands.

San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission
The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional
authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance San Francisco Bay and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive use
for this and future generations. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan and relies on it, the
McAteer-Petris Act, and other regulatory authority to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The Commission
issues permits for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and within salt ponds and
certain managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977.
By state statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay
and exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The Commission leads the ongoing multi-
agency regional effort to address the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on the Bay and its environs. Funding for
these efforts to address climate change is derived mainly from federal grants and other agreements, contracts, and
reimbursements.

San Diego River Conservancy
The mission of the San Diego River Conservancy is to achieve the goals of the San Diego River Conservancy Act by
implementing five major programs: Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Preserve Natural/Cultural Resources, Water
Quality and Natural Flood Conveyance, and Organizational Capacity and Reach. This mission will be accomplished in part by
building, with our partners, a San Diego River Park and hiking trail stretching from the headwaters in Julian to the Pacific
Ocean. These programs foster collaboration among governments and nonprofit organizations, and leverage grant funding to
achieve an array of conservation objectives.

Department of Water Resources
The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department
evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs and explores future potential solutions to meet ever-growing
needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to
prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its
efficient use.
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN
The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water
resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to
consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water
conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water
supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan
identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation,
recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration,

groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected
catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare
integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure
sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development,
protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water Element for their
General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local agencies and
tribal governments improve coordination between water and land use planning.
3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM
The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21
pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,
pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland.
The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities which provide
water to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County.
The California WaterFix Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe,
timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the California WaterFix, project specific environmental
commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and
federal regulations and permits.
3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE
This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper
construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for the construction. Activities include
assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use
of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities,
coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in
cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way
for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and
reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities
associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The
program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety.
3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD
The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC),
designated floodways and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by
issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that
protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large
joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies that operate
and maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for
stakeholders.
3255 - SERVICES
This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning,
development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory;
information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies.
3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING
For a limited period of time, this program purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. Beginning
January 1, 2003, the utility companies resumed responsibility for purchasing power from the spot market. The utilities, however,
continued to receive power from the Department's long-term energy contracts with energy suppliers, under which the
Department retains legal and financial responsibility. All energy contracts signed by the Department have now expired or were
terminated. However, litigation continues against some of the counterparties to these contracts. Additionally, the Department
retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering $4.621 billion in revenue bonds issued to repay the General Fund
for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and funding of reserve accounts necessary to maintain an
investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control
system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage
facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700
miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated
farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate
reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the
Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank
protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs,
pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood
protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

Delta Stewardship Council
Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is
to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and
enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and
enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted
a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta.
Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other
relevant agencies. The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent
Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to
inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
