Corps for this program.
•

4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS
The Department accepts commitments from California courts provided that the person to be committed meets age
requirements, can materially benefit from institutional programs, and there are adequate facilities available to care for the
individual.
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities,
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, and provide juvenile offenders necessary
services such as security, feeding, clothing, and facility operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, juvenile
offender intake and court services, population management services, facility maintenance, and maintains juvenile offender
master files. This program currently oversees operations for three facilities and one conservation camp.
Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post
release planning for each offender. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based treatment
programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption therapy,
sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp programs,
and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior and
reduce recidivism and relapse.
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the
California Education Authority. Its mission is to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and
knowledgeable lifelong learner. A key goal for education is to prepare student wards for successful transition to the community
upon release.
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State
Standards and earn the appropriate amount of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education,
English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for
work experience.

CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
CDCR is required by statute to accept convicted felons from California courts when their sentence is imprisonment in a state
correctional facility. The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - General Security program is to
provide safe and secure detention facilities to protect public safety. This program consists of 34 correctional institutions, 6 of
which have reception centers, 1 leased facility, and 43 conservation camps. This program also identifies custody overtime
expenditures associated with housing, guarding, and transporting inmates.
4540 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INMATE SUPPORT
The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Inmate Support program is to provide necessary services
to inmates such as feeding, clothing, record keeping, and inmate classification assessments at 34 correctional institutions, 1

fire prevention, watershed management, and soil conservation.
4545 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - CONTRACTED FACILITIES
The objective of the Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Contracted Facilities program is to reduce overcrowding
within CDCR and to provide meaningful rehabilitative programs in the least restrictive housing. These facilities are the

escapee apprehension, major criminal investigations, and critical incident response training.
4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION
The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and
degree of successful reintegration and release to society of offenders paroled from state prison. The program is responsible for
providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The main components
of supervision include Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring, the Sex Offender Management Program which
incorporates the containment model strategy as required by statute, and general caseload supervision utilizing the California
Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices into the Division of Adult Parole
Operations' supervision strategies to elicit long-term behavioral change to reduce recidivism.
Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the offender's risk
and current service needs. Based on case assessments, parolees may be placed in a higher-supervision category intended to
prevent, detect, or interrupt behavior likely to endanger the community. Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification
are regularly scheduled based on parolee behavior and stability in the community.
The other integral program component is the Parole Planning and Placement Program, which identifies parolee needs and
matches them with state and local programs to support a successful transition into local communities.

Transitional Work Programs, Cognitive Behavioral Treatment, Substance Use Disorder Treatment, and other Wraparound
Services. The program includes a full continuum of transitional programs, including Integrated Services for Mentally Ill
Parolees, Transitional Case Management Program, and sex offender treatment for all sex offenders on parole.
The program also provides mental health services and treatment to parolees through CDCR's Parole Outpatient Clinics. The
objective of these services is to reduce recidivism through the stabilization and monitoring of the parolees' mental health
issues.
4565 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT ADMINISTRATION

4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS
The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and
decisions, and to provide the required due process to inmates throughout the hearing process.
For adult offenders, the Board of Parole Hearings is responsible for setting the terms and conditions of parole and conducting
parole consideration hearings for eligible inmates serving life sentences, including certain parole violators pursuant to Penal
Code Section 3000.1. In January 2014, the Board began conducting youth offender parole hearings for eligible offenders
sentenced under both the Indeterminate Sentence Law and Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to Chapter 312, Statutes of
2013. In 2014, the Board also began conducting parole hearings for inmates eligible for elderly parole sentenced under both
the Indeterminate Sentence Law and the Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to a federal court order. Beginning in January
2015, the Board started evaluating certain inmates sentenced under the state's Second Strike Law for parole, pursuant to the
same federal court order. The Board also conducts medical parole hearings and determines whether parolees should be
discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for mentally disordered offenders and sexually violent predators, and
subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of Mental Health. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board
investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons and commutations of sentence, including those involving
the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court that a prisoner's sentence be recalled due to the
inmate's significant health condition.
Chapter 312, Statutes of 2013 (SB 260) required the Board to establish parole suitability hearings for offenders who were under
18 at the time they committed their controlling offense. Chapter 471, Statutes of 2015 (SB 261) extended the youth offender
hearings to inmates who were under the age of 23 at the time of their offense. SB 261 specified that the Board complete a new
comprehensive risk assessment for each youth offender scheduled for a parole hearing that specifically addresses the
diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to that of adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any subsequent growth
and increased maturity of the individual. Chapter 675, Statutes of 2017 (AB 1308) expands youth offender hearings to inmates
who were under the age of 26 at the time of their offense.
For juvenile offenders, the Juvenile Parole Board is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from the
jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Facilities to the jurisdiction of the committing court, and disciplinary appeals.

Board of State and Community Corrections
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and
technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal
justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 public safety realignment.
This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices, including prevention, intervention,
suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with
the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for
managing criminal justice populations.
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure
Overview."

Prison Industry Authority
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries
in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee,
the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker
of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the
Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the
Board.
The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good
work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA
work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming.
The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that
provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within
enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work
productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work
programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services
to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its
operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
