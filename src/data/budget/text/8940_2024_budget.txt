8940   Military Department 
The Military Department is responsible for the command, leadership and management of the California National Guard, Youth 
and Community Programs, State Guard and the Naval Militia. The California Military Department, under proper authority, 
organizes, resources, and trains forces with unique capabilities to serve the community, state, and nation. The purpose of the 
California National Guard is to provide mission ready forces to the federal government as directed by the President, emergency 
public safety support to civil authorities as directed by the Governor, and support to our member's families and to the 
community. With an authorized strength of approximately 19,000, the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are 
organized, manned, and funded in accordance with federal Departments of the Army and Air Force regulatory guidance. 
The Military Department Youth and Community Programs serve California communities and families by delivering national 
level, high quality educational support programs, in partnership with the educational community, within a military, academic 
structured environment. 
Because the Military Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6911 - NATIONAL GUARD 
The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our 
State Guard. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, communications, law 
enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air defense, airlift and unmanned 
aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The Office of the Adjutant General 
element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such as personnel and fiscal resource 
management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information technology. The Military Civil Support 
element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so that mutual understanding and unity of 
purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, prepare, and train for the deployment of 
Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called to state service by the Governor due to 
domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and other public agencies with the coordination 
necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Guard is a volunteer component of the Military Department whose 
mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during training, preparation for mobilization, demobilization, and 
provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state emergencies. The federal government provides virtually all 
supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support services necessary for training, deployment, and commitment of 
the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance with the Department of the Army and Air Force Regulations and 
Training Guidance. 
6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS 
The Military Department manages and maintains partnerships with the following twelve programs while serving more than 
13,000 youth annually: California Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, Porterville Military 
Academy, Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy, California Job ChalleNGe, 
STARBASE Academy Sacramento, STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos, STARBASE Academy Porterville, and STARBASE 
Academy San Luis Obispo. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 by the California Legislature and then- Adjutant 
General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program that is designed to provide maximum growth and 
leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school levels. It provides leadership opportunities for cadets 
by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as leaders in their cadet military units, and by demonstrating 
proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their communities. As part of their training, cadets aid and support to the 
school and community. The Oakland Military Institute, California Military Institute, and Porterville Military Academy develops 
leaders of character by providing rigorous programs to promote excellence in academics, leadership, citizenship, athletics, and 
physical fitness/wellbeing. Additionally, the programs instill the 10 Cadet Corps values of loyalty, education, ambition, duty, 
enthusiasm, respect, service, health, integrity, and personal courage. Using a military framework, these programs graduate 
cadets who can meet the admissions requirements for college and who are prepared for their roles as future leaders. The 
mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is to intervene in and reclaim the lives of 15½-18 year old high school 
dropouts. Graduates leave the program with the values, life skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as 
productive citizens. California Job ChalleNGe located at Los Alamitos, CA is a continuation program to provide vocational skills 
to California ChalleNGe graduates. The overall mission provides post-secondary Career Technical Education (CTE) training to 
place graduates into viable jobs. The goal of the Department of Defense STARBASE program is to motivate elementary school 
students, primarily 5th graders, to explore Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as they continue their 
education. The curriculum is designed to increase student involvement and interest in STEM, enhance their understanding of 
the role that STEM literacy plays in their lives, strengthen potential for future careers, and make the pursuit of STEM activities

more attractive and accessible. While attending STARBASE students interact with military personnel to explore careers and 
observe STEM applications in the "real world." These twelve youth programs are financed with federal, state and local funds. 
The California National Guard is involved in youth programs because political and community leaders at the federal, state, and 
local levels recognize that the National Guard brings structure, discipline, and effective leadership training methods to the 
educational setting.
