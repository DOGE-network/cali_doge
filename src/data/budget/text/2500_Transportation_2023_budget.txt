2670   Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and 
Suisun 
The Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun is the oversight body that licenses 
and regulates the maritime pilots who navigate certain large vessels entering or leaving those bays, Monterey Bay, and on 
tributaries to Sacramento and Stockton. 
The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident 
investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and 
providing pilotage fee rate recommendations to the Legislature. The seven members of the Board are appointed by the 
Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio member. The Board 
was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850. 
All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by 
the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost 
of Board operations, and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Four separate surcharges are based upon ship movements 
and fund a continuing education program for pilots, a pilot trainee training program, the acquisition of the Pilot Dispatch 
Program for use by pilots, and one temporarily funds pilot boat maintenance. Two separate surcharges are based on the 
tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the 
San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2050 - TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT 
The objectives of this program are to minimize deaths, injuries, and property losses due to traffic accidents; to reduce traffic 
delays to the motoring public; to provide protection and assistance to the motoring public, state employees and property, 
including protection of the State Capitol and the surrounding grounds, state constitutional officers, and visiting dignitaries; and 
to curtail the potential for terrorist threats as part of broader state and federal homeland security efforts. These objectives are 
achieved through both ground and flight operations. 
2055 - REGULATION AND INSPECTION 
The CHP operates 55 commercial vehicle enforcement facilities statewide with the objectives of: 
• Reducing the incidence of truck and bus accidents attributable to defective vehicle equipment, improper maintenance, 
loading or securing of cargo, or disqualified drivers. 
• Protecting the public from spills of hazardous materials or specially regulated loads, and from the improper operation of 
specified vehicles such as ambulances and armored cars. 
• Protecting farm workers transported in farm labor vehicles and children transported in school buses. 
• Ensuring that proper registration fees are paid, and protecting highways from excessive vehicle weights.

The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) promotes driver safety by licensing drivers and protects consumers by issuing 
vehicle titles and regulating vehicle sales. 
Because DMV's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, DMV has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on DMV's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."
