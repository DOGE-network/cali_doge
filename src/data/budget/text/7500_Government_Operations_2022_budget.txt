cannabis taxes provide funding for youth education and prevention programs, medical research, environmental mitigation 
efforts, law enforcement, and administration costs for numerous state agencies charged with licensing, regulating, and taxing 
the cultivation and sale of cannabis. 
6275750 - ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE EXCISE TAX PROGRAM 
This program collects tax revenues on the sales price of electronic cigarettes sold for use in California. All revenues, interest, 
and penalties, less refunds, collected from the tax are deposited into the California Electronic Cigarette Excise Tax Fund. The 
program ensures that all tax revenues are collected in an equitable and effective manner through accurate reporting of tax 
liability. This is accomplished by detecting and correcting errors in self-assessments, and promptly collecting amounts 
determined to be due and economically recoverable. 
6275760 - COUNTY REVENUE PROPERTY TAX REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM 
This Program administers the County Revenue Property Tax Reimbursement Program that was created by the passage of 
Proposition 19 on the November 2020 ballot.  CDTFA is responsible for determining each eligible local agency’s aggregate gain 
or loss in property taxes every three years, based on the amounts reported by the counties. Counties with a negative gain are 
eligible to receive a reimbursement from the County Revenue Protection Fund. If the County Revenue Protection Fund is 
insufficient to reimburse all claims, CDTFA is required to allocate available funds based on each local agency’s pro rata share. 
The CDTFA administers the program in partnership with the Franchise Tax Board. 
6275775 - SMALL BUSINESS HIRING CREDIT PROGRAM 
This Program administers the Small Business Hiring Credit Fund.  The fund allows small business employers to receive a tax 
credit equal to $1,000 for each net increase in qualified employees that can be applied against qualified sales, use, or income 
taxes.  CDTFA administers the tentative credit reservation process and allocates the tax credit.  The CDTFA administers the 
program in partnership with the Franchise Tax Board. 
9900100 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program provides leadership, legal, planning, policy, research, communication, internal audit, equal employment 
opportunity, and other essential services necessary to support the Department's programmatic goals and objectives. This 
support includes central administrative services in accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human 
resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting. This program also provides 
administrative and personnel services for the BOE.

administering the personal income tax and the corporation tax. Tax program activities include taxpayer assistance and tax 
return processing, filing enforcement, audits, and tax collection functions. The program also includes the collection and 
distribution of voluntary contributions to, and on behalf of, certain non-profit charitable organizations. 
6285 - POLITICAL REFORM AUDIT 
 
This program determines the accuracy and completeness of political statements and reports filed with the Secretary of State, 
and compliance with disclosures and record keeping requirements. On behalf of the Fair Political Practices Commission 
(FPPC), and in compliance with the Political Reform Act of 1974, the Franchise Tax Board conducts field audits of state and 
local candidates, measures committees, lobbying entities, committees supporting and opposing political candidates and 
statewide measures. These entities are randomly selected by the FPPC and/or meet dollar thresholds. 
6290 - DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES COLLECTIONS PROGRAM 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent motor vehicle license fees, taxes, and penalties on behalf of 
the Department of Motor Vehicles by utilizing the same collection capabilities that are used to collect the personal income tax. 
6295 - COURT COLLECTION PROGRAM 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent fines, penalties, and orders imposed by, and on behalf of, 
superior, municipal, and justice courts by utilizing the same automated collection capabilities that are used to collect the 
personal income tax. 
6300 - LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM 
This program reimburses the Department of Justice for legal services provided in support of Franchise Tax Board functions. 
6305 - CONTRACT WORK 
This program provides cost-effective goods and services to other governmental entities through contractual agreements. Such 
goods and services include rental space to on-site childcare and cafeteria entities, data processing services for other 
governmental entities, and delinquent debt collection services. 
9900100 - ADMINISTRATION

operations, developing and executing policies, making decisions concerning program operations, and ensuring that the Board's 
programs and services are carried out in accordance with Government Code sections 15701 and 15702. This program also

7760   Department of General Services 
The Department of General Services (DGS), as an enterprise organization under the Government Operations Agency, provides 
centralized services to state agencies in the areas of: management of state-owned and leased real estate, including design and 
construction of state infrastructure projects; approval of architectural designs for local schools and other state-owned building; 
printing services; procurement of commodities, services, and equipment for state agencies; and management of the state's 
vehicle fleet. Furthermore, DGS employs practices that support initiatives to reduce energy consumption and help preserve 
California resources. The Director of DGS serves on several state boards and commissions. 
Because DGS' programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

2022-23 STATE BUDGET — GOP 53
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES 
With a multi-billion dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for 
inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in 
public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds 
are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public 
building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school 
districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e) 
Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California. 
6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and 
equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties. 
6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES 
 
Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid 
redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate 
space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring  protection of lives and 
property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified 
parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their 
programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies, 
and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and 
ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners. 
6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES 
 
To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are 
essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and 
leveraged procurement agreements for information technology and non-information technology goods and services, green and 
sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing 
small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing 
the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include 
travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy 
efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, and budget, accounting and human resources services. 
Additionally, state and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct quasi-judicial hearings 
and mediations authorized by law. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This 
program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services, 
auditing, research and strategic planning, public affairs and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative 
services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, information technology, health and safety, and 
departmental procurement and contracting.

• Determine the eligibility of individuals for compensation for pecuniary injury sustained through erroneous conviction and 
imprisonment. 
• Process claims for the Missing Children Reward Program to assist local law enforcement agencies or other parties involved 
in the identification and recovery of missing children in California. 
• Process claims through the Good Samaritan Program to private citizens who are injured rescuing another person, preventing 
a crime, or assisting a law enforcement officer.

outreach campaign to raise awareness of statewide victim support services, while targeting hard-to-reach populations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer 
financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a 
claim with the CalVCB for program benefits. 
6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM 
This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery 
of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community 
(the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition 
and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 
the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $2.9 billion Proposition 2 debt repayment funding for a supplemental pension payment in 2022-23 to 
further reduce the state’s CalPERS unfunded liability. This is a supplemental payment in addition to the estimated $8.2 billion 
contribution that the state is statutorily-required to make to CalPERS in 2022-23. Contribution estimates incorporate retirement 
rates corresponding to the recent discount rate change from 7 percent to 6.8 percent. Based on current projections, an 
additional $5 billion in Proposition 2 funding is planned to be paid to CalPERS over the remaining forecast period (fiscal years 
2023-24 to 2025-26) depending on the future availability of those funds. 
• Although not reflected in 7900 - Public Employees' Retirement System, the Budget includes $143 million within the 
Proposition 2 debt repayment requirement to pay down the General Fund’s portion of a loan from the Surplus Money 
Investment Fund. This loan funded a one-time $6 billion supplemental pension payment towards the CalPERS state retirement 
plans in 2017-18.

5/ The 2022 Budget Act estimates 2022-23 other expenditures to be $1,178,765,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of 
Administration at its April 2022 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2022-23 Governor's Budget to the 2022 
Budget Act is primarily due to an increase in investment external management fees and technology expenses.

2/ This display does not reflect the $2.9 billion supplemental pension payment to the California Public Employees' 
Retirement System (CalPERS) in 2022-23 towards the unfunded liabilities of the state retirement plans that are included in 
the 2022 Budget Act. This display does not reflect the supplemental pension payments to CalPERS state plans included 
in the 2019 Budget Act, 2020 Budget Act, or 2021 Budget Act.
1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2022-23 Governor's Budget.
3/ The 2022 Budget Act estimates 2022-23 state contributions to CalPERS to be $7,474,890,000. The decrease in this 
estimate from the 2022-23 Governor's Budget to the 2022 Budget Act reflects a slight decrease in the state plans' 
employer contribution rate, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2022 meeting.
4/ The 2022 Budget Act estimates 2022-23 administrative expenditures to be $457,192,000, as approved by the CalPERS 
Board of Administration at its April 2022 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2022-23 Governor's Budget to the 
2022 Budget Act reflects anticipated increases in personal services and operating expenses and equipment captured in 
the expenditures approved in April 2022.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6410 - RETIREMENT 
CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for 
employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of 
duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2021, there were about 1,327,000 active and inactive members, and 
about 751,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 
Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. 
There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter, 
California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract 
with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit 
formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions. 
As of June 30, 2021, there were 2,892 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and 
survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their 
careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency 
retirement systems. 
CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 
6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY 
CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the 
federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age, 
Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.  As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the 
liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.  The program is responsible for 
administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting 
and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 
6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 
The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee 
associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees, 
retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs, 
provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer 
representatives. 
Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic, 
Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all 
eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial 
intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 
6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 
Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the 
purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired 
members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees' 
Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $477.3 billion, as of June 30, 2021. 
6425 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of 
the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy 
Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term 
Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

7910   Office of Administrative Law 
The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state 
regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these 
regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also 
responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been 
recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through 
a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members 
of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 
In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies 
constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 
The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the 
California Regulatory Notice Register.

7920   State Teachers' Retirement System 
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution 
plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred 
compensation plans and programs: 
• State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP) 
• CalSTRS Pension2 Personal Wealth Plan (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans) 
• Teachers' Health Benefits Fund 
• Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund 
CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school 
teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of 
June 30, 2021, there were over 980,000 members, retirees, and beneficiaries in the STRP Defined Benefit Program. 
CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement 
Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $3.7 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS in 2022-23. The decrease in funding for the 
Defined Benefit Plan from the previous fiscal year is largely due to an additional $174 million one-time General Fund payment 
in 2021-22. See 6300 - State Contribution to the State Teachers' Retirement System for more information.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS 
CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the 
distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the 
largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement 
benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may 
modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the 
member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's 
retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or 
contract provisions. 
Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the 
General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of 
administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
