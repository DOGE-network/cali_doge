2670   Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and 
Suisun 
The Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun is the oversight body that licenses 
and regulates the maritime pilots who navigate certain large vessels entering or leaving those bays, Monterey Bay, and on 
tributaries to Sacramento and Stockton. 
2021-22 STATE BUDGET — TRN 52

TRANSPORTATION
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident 
investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and 
providing pilotage fee rate recommendations to the Legislature. The seven members of the Board are appointed by the 
Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio member. The Board 
was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850. 
All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by 
the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost 
of Board operations, and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Three separate surcharges are based upon ship movements 
and fund a continuing education program for pilots, a pilot trainee training program, and the acquisition of navigation technology 
for use by pilots. Two separate surcharges are based on the tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay 
and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.

The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) promotes driver safety by licensing drivers and protects consumers by issuing 
vehicle titles and regulating vehicle sales. 
Because DMV's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, DMV has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on DMV's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."
