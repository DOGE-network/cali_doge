Legislative, 
Judicial, and 
Executive 
Governmental bodies classified under the 
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive section of the 
Governor's Budget are either established as 
independent entities under the California 
Constitution, or are departments with a recognized 
need to operate outside of the administrative 
oversight and control of an agency secretary. 
Constitutionally-established bodies include the 
Legislature, Judicial Branch, Governor's Office, 
and constitutional officers. This section also 
includes such independent entities as the 
Inspector General and the California State Lottery. 
0110   Senate 
The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. The State Senate is comprised of 40 members who are elected for 4-year terms. 
Members of the Legislature may serve a maximum of 12 years total in the Senate, the Assembly, or both, in any combination of 
terms. Members first elected before June 6, 2012, however, may generally serve a maximum of 14 years total, with no more 
than two terms in the Senate and three terms in the Assembly.

The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal 
and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee. 
Because the Legislature's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to 
support this need.  For the specifics on the Legislature's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was 
completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for 
construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.  The Annex, which was 
completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices. 
Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored, 
rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System 
Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional 
officers, and legislative statutory officers. 
 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of 
its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death, 
disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions. The Legislators' 
Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 
 
Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November 
6, 1990. Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340) 
closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory 
officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau 
The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members 
and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The 
legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending meetings of legislative committees as 
counsel, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all work is confidential. 
In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative 
measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes. 
The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the legislative 
information system and the processing of legislative measures.

0250   Judicial Branch 
Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of 
the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. 
Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially 
unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 
The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent 
funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was 
implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This 
implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The 
county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty 
revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments 
to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted 
by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act 
of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the 
counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial 
Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are 
deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of 
court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities 
based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 
The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, 
impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United 
States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 
Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

state funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc.
2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the trial courts. Excludes judges who are constitutional officers and not trial court employees.
3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 58 trial courts based on courts' 2020-21 Schedule 1 submissions, and includes both preliminary and certified submissions.

5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not 
included in the trial courts’ state funding in Section 1.
6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported 
in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not 
Distributed to Trial Courts" (Figure 2) amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for the "State Trial Court Funding Total."
7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences.  
For the current year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.
8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2019-20 and estimated expenditures for 2020-21 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2020-21 Enacted Budget.

the appropriated funds for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program.
6/ The 2020-21 estimated rent is incorporated into the request from each program that houses employees.
5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred 
to the JBWCF. For the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.
1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, GF, and JBWCF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state 
operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel).
2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, 
Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount 
in this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1). 
4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of trial courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training 
(DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects
3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid, excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" (Figure 1) 
revenue amounts reported ($145.9 million in 2019-20 and $140.4 million in 2020-21). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the 
TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2019-20 and 2020-21 participated in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0130 - SUPREME COURT 
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state 
courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the 
Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations 
for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of 
statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the 
Supreme Court. 
0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 
Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six 
District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the 
Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 
0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 
The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21 
voting members and 9 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as the 
administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation of 
the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and 
administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges, 
technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 
0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM 
The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of 
judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real 
estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction. 
0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING 
California has 58 trial courts, one in each county. In trial courts, or superior courts, a judge and sometimes a jury hears 
witnesses' testimony and other evidence and decides cases by applying the relevant law to the facts. Trial courts have trial 
jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases. To accomplish various statutory mandates, the State Trial Court Funding Program 
supports trial courts through the following programs: 
0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS 
This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and 
criminal cases. This program includes all allowable trial court administrative costs under Government Code section 77003. 
0150011 - COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNSEL 
This program provides funding for court-appointed counsel for children, non-minor dependents and parents in juvenile court 
dependency proceedings pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 317, subdivisions (b) and (c), and Government 
Code section 77003, subdivision (a)(4). 
0150019 - COMPENSATION OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES 
This program provides funding for the salaries and state benefits for Superior Court judges. 
0150028 - ASSIGNED JUDGES 
This program provides support for the salaries and related costs of retired as well as active judges who are assigned by the 
Chief Justice to positions in courts which require assistance due to judicial absences or other factors impacting the ability of a 
court to avoid case delay. 
0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS 
This program supports the provision of qualified language interpreters in criminal, juvenile, family and civil proceedings as 
required by statute. 
0150046 - GRANTS 
This program provides funding for government grants providing public services related to the trial courts.

0150051 – CHILD SUPPORT COMMISSIONER PROGRAM (AB 1058) 
This program provides funding for Child Support Commissioners and Family Law Facilitators in every court. 
0150067 – COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE (CASA) PROGRAM 
This program provides funding for non-profits designated by the court to train and provide volunteers to advocate for children in 
foster care. 
0150083 – EQUAL ACCESS FUND 
This program provides funding for legal services programs to provide a range of services to low-income litigants. 
0150095 - EXPENSES ON BEHALF OF THE TRIAL COURT 
This program provides appropriation for statewide programs and services provided to the court or courts by the Judicial Council 
or payment for services or property of any kind contracted for the court or courts or on behalf of the courts by the Judicial 
Council, which are paid for or reimbursed by the trial courts. The appropriation also supports the implementation and 
administration of the Civil Representation Pilot Program. 
In addition to the programs mentioned above, the State Trial Court Funding Program supports a number of smaller programs 
including Access to Visitation services in family law proceedings, JusticeCorps volunteers in the courts, and Substance Abuse 
Focus Grants supporting collaborative justice courts. 
0155 - HABEAS CORPUS RESOURCE CENTER 
The Habeas Corpus Resource Center provides legal representation for indigent petitioners in death penalty habeas corpus 
proceedings before the California state courts and the federal courts. The Center also recruits and trains attorneys to expand 
the pool of private counsel qualified to accept appointments in death penalty habeas corpus proceedings, serves as a resource 
to them, and thereby helps to reduce the number of unrepresented indigents on California's death row.

0280   Commission on Judicial Performance 
The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of 
judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California 
Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of 
California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or 
resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees. 
In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement. 
The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial 
misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation 
and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal 
from office. 
The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the 
Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, 
and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms. 
Commission members do not receive a salary.

0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and 
Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement 
System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members. 
The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in 
1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System 
II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final 
compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement 
System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of 
contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined 
benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II receives 
contributions from judges equal to 8 percent of salary as well as any investment income. The state's contributions are adjusted 
annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund. 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, 
compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges 
and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing 
fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit 
payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the 
required benefit payments to retired judges. 
 
Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 
2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

0552   Office of the Inspector General 
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional 
system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's 
(CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, staff complaints, and the employee disciplinary process. The Inspector 
General audits and reviews the policies, practices, and procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's 
candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the 
state's juvenile facilities, and conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at 
each state prison. OIG receives communications from individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-
free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; conducts formal reviews of

complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper management where a legally cognizable cause of action is 
present; and reviews sexual abuse incidents within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the 
state correctional system by publicly reporting its findings. 
In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (Board) that examines CDCR's various mental 
health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for inmates and parolees. The Board meets at least twice 
annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of offender rehabilitation and treatment programs. The Board 
also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of 
treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of offenders, gaps in offender rehabilitation services, and levels of offender participation

0650   Office of Planning and Research 
The Office of Planning and Research (OPR) assists the Governor and the Administration in planning, research, policy 
development, and legislative analysis. OPR formulates long-range state goals and policies to address four key areas: land use 
and planning, climate risk and resilience, sustainable economic development, and targeted long-range research needs. OPR 
acts as the state's liaison to a variety of entities including local and regional government, planning professionals, small 
business, and the Department of Defense. OPR also serves a role as convener across multiple agencies on cross-cutting 
issues in the four key areas of our work. 
The Office of Planning and Research includes three main budget programs: the State Policy Program (often referred to as 
OPR), which houses most of core planning and research functions; the California Strategic Growth Council, which coordinates 
and works collaboratively with public agencies, communities, and stakeholders to realize healthy, thriving, resilient communities 
for all and provides direct grant funding to projects demonstrating the value and feasibility of sustainable communities; and 
California Volunteers, a program aimed to increase the number and impact of Californians involved with service and 
volunteering throughout the state.

0370 - CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL 
The California Strategic Growth Council (SGC) coordinates and works collaboratively with public agencies, communities, and 
stakeholders to advance healthy, thriving, and resilient communities for all. SGC integrates State, regional, and local efforts to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions; increase the availability of affordable housing located near jobs, services, and green space; 
conserve agriculture lands; promote public health; and advance racial equity. SGC administers the following grant programs: 
Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities; Transformative Climate Communities; Sustainable Agricultural Lands 
Conservation; Climate Change Research – all of which are part of the California Climate Investments Program, funded by 
proceeds from the State’s cap-and-trade auction revenues. SGC operates these funding programs in collaboration with 
interagency teams to develop program guidelines, review applications, and administer program funds. SGC’s Community 
Assistance for Climate Equity Program encompasses both the Regional Climate Collaboratives, which supports local capacity 
building and technical assistance in under-resourced communities across California; and the California Climate Investments 
Technical Assistance Program, which increases access to SGC’s own grant programs as well as those of many other State 
agencies. SGC partners with High-Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) to support sustainable development and conservation 
practices, especially in future HSR station areas. SGC’s Health and Equity Program advances the integration of health and 
equity principles in State programs and planning through the Health in All Policies Task Force, partnerships and collaborations, 
and in the implementation of SGC’s Racial Equity Action Plan. Finally, SGC is charged with reviewing the State’s 5-Year 
Infrastructure Plan and to contribute to interagency efforts to promote sustainability, equity, and resilience in State investments.

0690   Office of Emergency Services 
The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency 
response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's 
Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's 
homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, 
protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats. 
Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal 
agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in 
emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own 
resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the 
federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California. 
During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's 
responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal 
assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the

development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes 
prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 
Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and 
the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS 
assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of and response to criminal and terrorist activity and also facilitates 
information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission is a separate unit within the Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to 
lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well 
as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management. 
Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

provided $21.9 million one-time General Fund in 2020-21 as a part of a comprehensive package to increase the pace and 
scale of forest health activities and reduce wildfire risk. In total, the Budget includes a $1.5 billion wildfire prevention and 
forest resilience investment over three years ($536 million in 2020 21, $458 million in 2021-22, and $500 million in 2022 23). 
Allocations for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 budgets will be determined in subsequent legislation. 
• Building Resilience—The Budget includes $100 million one-time General Fund for Community Hardening to Build Disaster 
Resilient Communities. Specifically, this funding will support community hardening efforts within under-resourced 
communities by covering the local government’s cost share for participating in the federal hazard mitigation grant program 
and providing outreach and technical assistance to disadvantaged local communities and governments as they apply for 
federal grants. 
• Victims of Crime Act Supplemental Funding—The Budget includes $100 million one-time General Fund to supplement 
federal funding supporting a variety of services for domestic violence victims. This one-time augmentation will allow existing 
programs to continue, while building capacity to handle the increased need. 
• Strengthening California’s Emergency Response Capacity and Capabilities—The Budget includes $60.6 million ongoing 
General Fund and 114 positions to strengthen California’s emergency capacity and capabilities to respond to increasingly 
complex disasters, security threats, and emergencies; maximize federal funds for disasters; modernize technology and data 
analytics; and strengthen equity and connections with vulnerable populations. Specifically, the budget includes the following: 
◦ Incident Response Team—$16.5 million ongoing General Fund and 73 positions to establish permanent and dedicated 
incident response teams and needed support to operate California’s State Operations Center or Regional Emergency 
Operations Centers to respond to all-hazard events. These teams will strengthen the capabilities of the State Operations 
Center and lessen the Department’s reliance on redirected staff from other areas in the organization. 
◦ Strengthening Equity and Connections with Communities—$29.9 million ongoing General Fund and 13 positions to 
establish a new Office of Equity and make permanent an annual $25 million Listos California grant program to further 
strengthen connections and build resiliency with all communities. 
◦ Modernizing Technology and Data Analytics—$10.2 million ongoing General Fund and 14 positions to modernize the 
Department’s technology and data capabilities through new technology and updating outdated systems. 
◦ Strengthening Tracking and Reporting of Disaster Costs and Funding—$4 million ongoing General Fund and 14 positions 
to establish a new unit within Cal OES to better coordinate and lead the state’s disaster cost tracking and reporting efforts 
in coordination with all state agencies. This new unit will serve as a liaison. 
• Nonprofit Security Grant Program—The Budget includes $50 million one-time General Fund for the California State Nonprofit 
Security Grant Program, to assist nonprofit organizations that have historically been targets of hate-motivated violence. This 
program, administered by the Cal OES, provides support for target hardening and other physical security enhancements to 
nonprofit organizations that are at high risk of violence and hate crimes based on ideology and beliefs. 
• Long Term Recovery Support—The Budget includes $37.8 million ($15.7 million General Fund) ongoing to provide 
permanent funding for 104 permanent recovery positions provided in 2018 with three-year limited-term funding, and 110 new 
positions to better support California’s recovery efforts and recoupment of eligible federal disaster cost reimbursements for 
the state and local governments, and to maximize the hazard mitigation program to mitigate the impacts of future disasters 
on the state and local jurisdictions. 
• COVID-19 Direct Response Expenditures—The Budget includes a total of $1.7 billion for various state departments for direct 
response costs associated with responding to and mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021-22. 
Specifically, the budget includes $18.9 million one-time General Fund for Cal OES for state response operation costs to 
continue providing resources through the State Operation Center and funding subject matter experts for various response 
activities. 
• California Earthquake Early Warning System—The Budget includes $17.3 million one-time General Fund to continue to 
support system operations and program management, an education and outreach campaign, and research and development 
to expand earthquake mitigation use of the system. 
• Gun Violence Restraining Orders—The Budget includes $11 million one-time General Fund to facilitate education and 
training efforts related to gun violence restraining orders. This funding includes: (1) $5 million for to conduct a public 
awareness campaign, (2) $5 million for grants to domestic violence groups to conduct outreach, and (3) $1 million to the City 
of San Diego for the city attorney to provide temporary gun violence restraining order trainings to entities statewide. 
• Medical Evidentiary Sexual Assault Examination Reimbursement Claims—The Budget includes $6.7 million ongoing General

Fund to increase reimbursements to local law enforcement agencies to offset the cost of reimbursing qualified health care 
professionals, hospitals, or other emergency medical facilities for medical evidentiary examinations for all sexual assault 
victims. 
• Regional Hazardous Materials Response—The Budget includes $3.6 million ongoing General Fund to continue 
implementation of the Regional Hazardous Materials Response program, which strategically positions and trains response 
teams throughout the state in high risk areas to respond to hazardous material incidents. 
• Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center (SB 209)—The Budget includes $7.5 million General Fund in 
2021-22, $4.5 million ongoing General Fund, and 22 positions for Cal OES, California Military Department, Department of 
Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), and Public Utilities Commission to implement Chapter 405, Statutes of 2019 (SB 
209) which requires Cal OES and CAL FIRE to establish a Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center 
(Wildfire Forecast Center). The Wildfire Forecast Center will: (1) provide “real time” intelligence and data regarding wildfire 
threats to government agencies; (2) develop intelligence products for public and private entities involved in wildfire risk 
mitigation efforts; and (3) serve as a central organizing hub for wildfire forecasting, weather information, threat intelligence 
gathering, and analysis. This additional investment builds on the $2 million ongoing General Fund provided in the 2020 
Budget Act for a total investment of $9.5 million, of which $2.8 million is appropriated to Cal OES.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
 
Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program 
coordinates the provision of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended 
in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-
hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National 
Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this 
program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to 
all hazards. 
0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 
Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services 
grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland 
Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency 
management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant 
management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with 
financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the 
centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion 
center. 
0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent 
earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s 
progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.  The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate, 
and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.  The 
Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support 
the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.  These activities include: (1) developing and 
reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related 
legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies, 
where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and 
supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery. 
0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 
The Public Safety Communications program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the 
state's public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The program is dedicated to the 
preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that 
keep the public connected during times of crisis. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE 
The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of Cal OES and support services such as 
accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.

0750   Office of the Lieutenant Governor 
Under California's Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor serves as Acting Governor whenever the Governor is absent from the 
state, and automatically becomes Governor if a vacancy occurs in the Office of Governor. The Lieutenant Governor is also 
President of the Senate and votes in case of a tie. 
The Lieutenant Governor serves as a voting member of the Board of Regents of the University of California, the Board of 
Trustees of the California State University system, and the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges system. 
The Lieutenant Governor also sits on the Calbright College Board of Trustees. 
The Lieutenant Governor also serves on, and rotates with the State Controller, as chair of the three-member State Lands 
Commission, which oversees the control and leasing of millions of acres of state-owned land, including offshore oil resources, 
as well as use and permitting for all navigable waterways in California. The Commission also manages state land-use planning 
and revenues, and related interstate issues. During alternate years, when the Lieutenant Governor serves as Chairperson of 
the State Lands Commission, the Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of the Ocean Protection Council and as a 
non-voting member of the California Coastal Commission. 
In addition, under state statutes, the Lieutenant Governor chairs the California Commission for Economic Development, which 
provides support and guidance to the Governor, Legislature, and private sector regarding the development of California's 
economy.

civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them, and prosecutes cases to vindicate state 
interests. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases before administrative 
tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the United States and 
California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of nine sections: Business and Tax; Cannabis Control; Correctional Law; 
Employment and Administrative Mandates; Government Law; Health, Education, and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement; 
Licensing; or Tort and Condemnation. 
Criminal Law represents the People of the State of California in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts. 
Criminal Law also fulfills the Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are 
recused, conducting criminal investigations, representing the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole 
decisions and conditions of confinement in the state prisons, and defending criminal judgements in state and federal habeas 
corpus matters. Additional responsibilities include enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition 
matters, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving white-collar crimes, high-tech/computer/privacy 
crimes, financial crimes, human trafficking, environmental crimes, and public corruption.

0440 - LAW ENFORCEMENT 
The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five areas: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3) 
Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief. 
The Bureau of Firearms provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms and 
ammunitions laws by administering a multitude of different state-mandated firearms and ammunition-related programs. It is 
accomplished by conducting firearm and ammunition eligibility checks, conducting compliance inspections at firearm dealers, 
ammunition vendors, and manufacturers, and by providing valuable training to stakeholders statewide. Special Agents conduct 
investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of firearms, magazines, and 
ammunition. Agents also conduct investigations to monitor and prevent illegal firearm trafficking at permitted gun shows in 
accordance with state and federal laws. 
The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and analysis of physical evidence, crime scene investigation, and 
expert court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts. The BFS operates 10 
regional crime laboratories and two specialized laboratories, the Jan Bashinski DNA Laboratory and Statewide Toxicology 
Laboratory, which  serve 46 of California’s 58 counties. The BFS also operates the California Criminalistics Institute forensic 
training facility that provides training for forensic scientists worldwide. The BFS maintains the state DNA database, which stores 
and regularly searches the DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees against the DNA profiles of evidence 
from unsolved crimes. 
The Bureau of Gambling Control regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted honestly and 
is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of individuals and 
business entities who apply for licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance with the Gambling 
Control Act and applicable regulations. The Bureau conducts criminal investigations in and around tribal casinos and California 
cardrooms. In addition, the Bureau conducts audits and reviews for tribal gaming to ensure that each tribe is in compliance with 
all aspects of the state gaming compact. 
The Bureau of Investigation is the premiere investigative bureau that is responsible for investigating and dismantling criminal 
organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses which present a significant and multi-
jurisdictional threat to California. The Bureau prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal organizations involved in 
gangs, as well as cases involving  major white-collar fraud, underground economy, drug trafficking, recycle fraud, officer-
involved shootings, homicides, foreign prosecution, human trafficking and sexual predator apprehension crimes. In addition, the 
Bureau serves a principal role in providing leadership, coordination, and support to law enforcement through intelligence units 
and multi-agency drug, gang and major crimes task forces statewide. 
The Office of the Chief provides administrative support to the investigative, regulatory, and forensic components of the Division 
of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies. The Office serves as the policy-making and oversight body for its four 
operational bureaus. 
0445 - CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES 
The California Justice Information Services Division provides criminal justice intelligence, information, and identification 
services to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the public. Four major functional areas carry out these primary services: 
1) The Justice Data and Investigative Services Bureau consolidates the identification, investigative, and field services functions, 
providing information and technical assistance on manual and automated systems including the fingerprint identification system 
and the violent crime information system; 2) The Bureau of Criminal Information and Analysis consolidates the functions related 
to the authorization, release, and use of criminal offender record information for law enforcement investigatory and regulatory 
purposes; 3) The Hawkins Data Center operates the Criminal Justice Information System and the California Law Enforcement 
Telecommunications System, as well as provides IT services for the Attorney General’s Office; 4) the Operations Support 
Program provides business resumption planning and administrative support and oversight; and 5) the Department of Justice 
Research Center, within the Operations Support Program, oversees statistical models and engages in the analysis of data to 
provide evidence-based research. 
9900 - DIRECTORATE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Directorate and the Administration Division of the Department of Justice consists of the Division of Operations and the 
Attorney General's Executive Office. The Executive Office maintains the overall direction and administration of the diverse 
programs and projects of the department, including the Equal Employment Rights and Resolution Office, the Office of Program 
Oversight and Accountability, the Opinions Unit, the Solicitor General's Unit, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Office of 
Communications and the Public Inquiry Unit. In addition, the Division of Operations provides support functions essential to the 
department's operations, including fiscal, personnel, and specialized business services such as legal secretarial support, 
litigation support, legal case management services, and facilities management.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has 96 facilities statewide totaling 1.8 million square feet, of which 14 facilities and 1.2 million 
square feet are state-owned locations.  The remaining facilities are leased from non-state entities. 
These facilities support the constitutional office of the Attorney General who, as Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the state, has 
the responsibility to see that the laws of California are uniformly and adequately enforced. This responsibility is fulfilled through 
the diverse legal, law enforcement and criminal justice information programs of the DOJ. 
0840   State Controller 
The State Controller is the chief fiscal officer of California, the fifth largest economy in the world. Principally responsible for 
transparency and accountability of the state's financial resources, the Controller ensures the appropriate disbursement and 
tracking of taxpayer dollars. The Controller serves on dozens of state boards, commissions, and committees with 
duties ranging from administrative oversight of the nation's two largest public pension funds, to protection of state lands and 
coastlines, to modernization and financing of major infrastructure. The Controller also offers fiscal guidance to local 
governments and has independent auditing authority over government agencies related to the spending of state funds. The 
Controller's primary objectives are to: 
• Account for and control disbursement of all state funds, issuing warrants in payment of the state's bills, including lottery 
prizes. 
• Determine legality and accuracy of financial claims against the state.

complaints annually, performs ongoing risk-focused financial surveillance of insurance companies, receives more than 23,000 
suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually and investigates approximately 1,300 of those referrals, receives and reviews

0845   Department of Insurance - Continued
2021-22 STATE BUDGET — LJE 183
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to ensure they can provide the 
benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and 
underlying assumptions to avoid reliance on “black box” models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurance 
companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty insurance rates 
are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the Insurance Code and the California Code 
of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance sector; (6) review health 
insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance companies to get 
unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases are actuarially 
justified and not excessive; (8) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and 
maintain the qualifications for licensure. Additionally, CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance 
companies through the Conservation and Liquidation Office. 
0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders 
and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or 
underwriting by insurers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent practices or 
incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved communities and (4) 
assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community service organizations, and neighborhood 
associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed informational guides, workshops, seminars, 
roundtables and town halls. 
0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 
The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for 
prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace 
officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the 
Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition, 
the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against 
perpetrators of insurance fraud. 
0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE 
This program performs tax collection, ensures the compliance of insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws 
contained in the Insurance Code and Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and Fee 
Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the premium 
tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

0850   California State Lottery Commission 
In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an 
initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it 
broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to 
benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by 
the State Senate. 
The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34 
percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be 
used for administrative costs. 
In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost 
limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of 
contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery 
Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily 
Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the 
University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 
In the 35 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2020, the California State Lottery has raised $37.6 billion 
for public education, including approximately $1.5 billion in FY 2019-20. 
Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2020-21 and 2021-22 cannot be made 
with certainty.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0570025 - COUNTY ASSESSMENT STANDARDS PROGRAM 
This program ensures that taxable properties are enrolled and assessed by the 58 county assessors in full conformity with the 
law. The BOE is also charged with providing consultation and services to the county assessors and their staff, establishing 
standards, providing training for assessors and assessment appeals boards, evaluating the effectiveness of each county 
assessor's administration, co-administering the welfare exemption, and administering the Legal Entity Ownership Program. 
0570050 - STATE-ASSESSED PROPERTY PROGRAM 
 
This program values and assesses inter-county pipelines and properties owned or used by railroads, regulated telephone 
companies, companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity, and private railroad car companies. Local jurisdictions use the 
established values for the levy and collection of local property taxes. In addition, the BOE collects the Private Railroad Car Tax 
that is deposited in the state General Fund. 
0570150 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM 
This program collects the excise tax imposed on the sale, distribution, or importation of alcoholic beverages in California. The 
BOE contracts with the CDTFA to administer this program. 
0570575 - INSURANCE TAX PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue to the Insurance Tax Fund. Revenue is generated from taxes assessed on insurance 
premiums, underwriting profits from ocean marine insurance, and retaliatory assessments levied on out-of-state insurers. The 
taxes collected are used to pay refunds or transferred to the General Fund. The BOE contracts with the CDTFA to administer 
this program.

expenditure committees. The program registers lobbyists (including placement agents), lobbying firms and lobbyist employers, 
reviews for compliance with statutory requirements the periodic financial disclosure reports filed by lobbying entities, and 
publishes a Lobbying Directory on the Internet. This program also supports the electronic filing requirements of the Political 
Reform Act and posts relevant registration and disclosure information to the Office's web site so the public can track where 
campaign money is raised and spent and what lobbying activity is occurring in state government. A searchable database of 
campaign and lobbying financial activity is also provided through the web site.

economical management methods to the creation, utilization, maintenance, retention, preservation, and disposal of state 
records and acquires, indexes, preserves, and provides reference access to irreplaceable historic materials from the three

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES 
The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption. 
During the 2019-20 fiscal year, this Division handled 8,964 security investment transactions totaling $415.4 billion. The Pooled 
Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 7,687 of these transactions totaling $383.5 billion; time deposits 
accounted for 1,002 transactions totaling $27.1 billion. The remaining $4.8 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special 
funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's 
retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment 
program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the 
2019-20 fiscal year, 2,362 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $27.3 billion for the fiscal year. 
0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 
In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System 
(CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires 
the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB, 
giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits, 
and loans to the General Fund. 
The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of 
the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that 
the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer 
maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for 
the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 
The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts 
available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer 
of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for 
payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities 
pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other 
state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or 
pledged to the state.

The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes, 
revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The 
Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to 
bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 
The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse 
consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance includes monitoring 
the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and 
ensuring proper record keeping. 
0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 
services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems, 
business services, technical support, and production operations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0780 - GOLDEN STATE SCHOLARSHARE COLLEGE SAVINGS TRUST PROGRAM 
The Golden State ScholarShare College Savings Trust Program is California's state-sponsored 529 college savings plan 
established to help families save for higher education. Earnings are tax-free when used for qualified higher education expenses 
(such as tuition, fees, supplies, books, computer equipment, and certain room and board expenses) at eligible educational 
institutions. 
0785 - GOVERNOR'S SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS 
The Governor's Scholarship Programs (GSP) rewarded public school students who demonstrated high academic achievement 
with scholarships. Students may have earned multiple $1,000 Governor's Scholars Awards and a one-time $2,500 Governor's 
Distinguished Mathematics and Science Scholars Award for scores attained on tests taken in 2000, 2001, and 2002. GSP 
became inoperative and was repealed after 2002. The ScholarShare Investment Board administered scholarship awards that 
were already earned until December 2019, when all students reached the age of 30 and all remaining scholarship awards were 
subsequently reverted to the State General Fund. 
0790 - CALIFORNIA MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 
The California Memorial Scholarship Program provides scholarships to surviving dependents of California residents killed as a 
result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee 
The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State 
of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit, 
such as the creation of affordable housing. 
The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual 
basis. Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by 
multiplying the state population by $105. California's limit totaled over $4.1 billion in 2020. (California's limit for the Qualified 
Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated separately by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $395 
million for 2020.) 
The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers 
authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state 
or federal government. 
The Committee administers five active programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private 
activity bonds.  The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the 
Governor, or upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
To lower the cost of financing, specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that 
support below-market interest rate mortgage loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that reduce a homebuyer's federal 
tax liability. Below is a summary of each program: 
Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost for developers of multifamily 
rental housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers 
produce affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and 
families. To qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or 
reserve at least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can 
apply for non-competitive four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit 
Allocation Committee Joint Application. 
Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs to assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes. 
Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses. Program 
participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations. 
Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds 
issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and 
midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their 
communities. 
Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance any of the following facilities identified by the IRS 
as an exempt facility, including but not limited to: solid waste disposal and waste recycling facilities, mass commuting facilities, 
high-speed rail, energy and power generating facilities, and sustainable design facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the 
project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to 
protect and enhance the environment. 
 
Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance the construction, 
renovation, and furnishing of primary and secondary school facilities.

The Authority was established to assist transportation agencies in obtaining financing to develop transportation projects. To 
meet this objective, statutes allow the Authority to issue, or to approve specified project sponsors to issue revenue bonds to 
fund transportation projects backed in whole or in part, by various revenue streams of transportation funds (including toll 
revenues). Statutes provide the authority to approve the imposition and collection of tolls on proposed transportation projects 
under certain conditions. The planning, programming, and allocation of transportation projects are performed by the California 
Transportation Commission and the California Department of Transportation, as appropriate. 
0968   California Tax Credit Allocation Committee 
The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and 
maintain safe, quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California. The Committee does this by forming 
partnerships with developers, investors and public entities. 
The Committee assists development of rental housing projects for low-income families and monitors these projects for years 
after they are placed in service to ensure compliance with federal and state tax credit program requirements of the Committee. 
Coordinating with state and local housing fund providers, and with private investors, the Committee helps to create and 
maintain a supply of quality, affordable housing. 
The Committee consists of seven members, including five voting members and two advisors. The voting members are the 
Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor (who may choose the Director of Finance as his or her 
representative), the State Controller, the Director of Housing and Community Development, and the Executive Director of the 
California Housing Finance Agency. The non-voting (advisory) members are two local government representatives. One local 
representative is associated with a city government and appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. The other is a county 
government representative appointed by the Senate Rules Committee.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
The Federal Program 
Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax 
incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise 
project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and 
indexed for inflation. 
Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the 
percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability 
annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of 
the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project 
sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each 
year for a ten-year period. 
The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation.  For 2020, each 
state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.81 per state resident.  Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share 
of unused credits in a national pool. 
Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects 
must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there 
is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. 
Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires 
maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance.

In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the 
federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for 
an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax 
credit status. 
The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2020, was $102.7 million. Investors take the state tax credit 
annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period. 
Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and the California Debt Limit 
Allocation Committee to issue an additional $500 million in state tax credits in 2020 to be paired with the 4% federal program to 
bolster new construction of low income housing. Per AB 83, this $500 million tax credit will be issued in 2021 pursuant to an 
authorization in the annual Budget Act or related legislation.

Farmworker Housing Program 
Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state 
LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017, 
these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and 
projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase.

The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes 
of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently 
utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the 
environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources, 
implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and 
lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit 
enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities 
needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies. 
The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director 
of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, 
and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the 
Authority, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as determined and 
approved by resolution of the Authority. 
The Authority is a conduit issuer of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance local district heating or cooling facilities, and 
private activity bonds for 501(c)(3) non-profits. Past issuances total more than $212 million in bond financing for green projects 
in California. 
In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative 
source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010). The STE program expanded (Chapter 677, Statutes of 
2012) to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 768, Statutes 
of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock and equipment 
that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of 2019, extended 
the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job creation-related criteria 
by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. The objective of this program is to promote the creation of California-based 
manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, and energy 
consumption. 
Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013 
(Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority 
developed a loan loss reserve program for residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and a risk 
mitigation program for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. Programs to support low-interest 
financing of Property Assessed Clean Energy efficiency projects in commercial buildings are in discussion. 
 
The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in 
collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission to develop and launch energy efficiency financing pilot programs to 
encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the residential and commercial sectors). These programs employ 
various types of credit enhancements, lower costs and expand access to capital for Californians making energy efficiency 
improvements to help achieve the state's energy efficiency and decarbonization goals. The residential pilot, launched in 2016, 
has now transitioned to a full program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM 
The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the 
acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment, 
waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority 
assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, 
the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, and more recently, Assembly Bill 1826 (Chesbro, Chapter 727, Statutes of 
2014), and Senate Bill 1383 (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016). As of June 30, 2020, bonds totaling approximately $16.4 
billion have been issued by the Authority.

LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The objective of this program is to inspire banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses. CalCAP for 
Small Business provides a form of loan loss recovery with up to 100 percent coverage on certain loan defaults. By participating 
in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to assist the financing needs of California's small 
businesses. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund specific to each participating financial 
institution. The Authority, financial institution, and borrower all contribute to fund the reserve. The Authority provides 
additional incentives for lending to businesses located in underserved communities and disaster areas. The reserve serves to 
reduce loan-loss risk, encouraging banks to lend to targeted California small businesses. 
Prior to 2010, CalCAP was entirely self-funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA's Small Business Assistance Fund 
(SBAF) established with fees collected from large companies financed through CPCFA's tax-exempt bond program.  In October 
2010, Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million from the General Fund to CalCAP to increase lending efforts. The 
$6 million appropriation was fully-expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual recapture of contributions to become the 
primary source for the State's contributions. 
In 2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from the federal State Small 
Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The allocation was shared between the Authority, $85 million, and the Governor's Office of 
Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz), $83 million.  These funds enabled the Authority to expand the availability of its 
CalCAP for Small Business statewide.  The Authority also launched the Collateral Support Program to offset lenders resistance 
to lend after the 2008 recession.  The federal funds were expended by the fourth quarter of 2018, allowing for all recaptured 
funds to stay with its state.  Funds are being recaptured annually to sustain both the State CalCAP for Small Business and the 
Collateral Support Program. 
Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority partnered with the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist truck and bus 
owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $215.9 million in Air Quality Improvement Program funds 
to incentivize lending for cleaner vehicles that comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The Authority also partnered 
with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit enhancements and rebates to 
small business borrowers and multi-unit dwellings to install electric vehicle charging stations. 
0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM 
The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived 
contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of contaminated properties 
(brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program 
provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000 which was later increased to $500,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with 
brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the development of remedial action plans. Eligible 
projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or 
perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process. 
Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund 
brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received 
$60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project for brownfield remediation that 
promoted affordable infill residential and mixed-used developments. In one instance, CALReUSE provided a grant in excess of 
$5 million in order to utilize returned funds.  All CALReUSE Program funds have been awarded. The CALReUSE Program's 
$60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will result in 5,587 housing units, of which more than 47% will be 
affordable, in 30 California communities. 
0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS 
Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative 
energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's 
environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and 
state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority. 
0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES ACT 
The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal 
Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other financial 
institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the Authority an 
appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the CalCAP 
model incentivizing lenders to enroll qualifying loans.  The program also offers borrowers a rebate toward the cost of the 
Certified Access Specialist (CASp) Report. 
0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM 
The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time 
allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to administer a credit enhancement program for qualified small businesses

and residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of 
Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other 
financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the 
program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM 
In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3 
established the second Children's Hospital Program. In 2018, Proposition 4 established a third Children’s Hospital Program. 
The purpose of the three programs is to improve the health and welfare of California's critically ill children by providing a stable 
and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's hospitals and, under Proposition 4, hospitals that 
provide pediatric services for children eligible for California Children’s Services. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is 
derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition 
3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4. 
0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES BONDS, LOANS, AND GRANTS 
The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health 
institutions. 
Tax-Exempt Bond Program 
Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt, liability, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power of 
the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for repayment of 
the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation or 
association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district.

0890 - MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANTS 
• Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 Grant Program 
Chapter 34, Statutes of 2013 (SB 82), the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 and related legislation provided 
$142.5 million in one-time General Fund, and $4 million in ongoing Mental Health Services Act funding to provide grants for 
community based mental health crisis support. 
The Act established a grant program to disburse funds to California counties or to their nonprofit or public agency designees for 
the purpose of developing mental health crisis support programs. Specifically, funds may be used to increase capacity for client 
assistance and services in crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, crisis residential treatment, rehabilitative mental health 
services, and mobile crisis support teams. The grants will support capital improvement, expansion and limited start-up costs. 
 
• Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for Children and Youth 
Chapter 30, Statutes of 2016 (SB 833), Section 20 created the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for 
Children and Youth to increase mental health services for children and youth 21 years of age and under to develop a complete 
continuum of crisis services. Working with counties, the program funds facility acquisition, construction/renovation, equipment 
acquisition, applicable startup or expansion costs, and limited personnel funding to develop crisis residential treatment and 
crisis stabilization facilities, mobile crisis support teams, and family respite care facilities. 
 
• Community Services Infrastructure Grants 
Chapter 33, Statutes of 2016 (SB 843), Section 52 created the Community Services Infrastructure competitive grant program to 
expand community alternatives to jail and prison. The program seeks to expand access to jail and prison diversion programs 
and services for those with mental health illness, substance use disorders, or who have suffered from trauma. Working with 
counties, the program funds facility acquisition, renovation, equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs for 
facilities that provide services to this population. 
• No Place Like Home Program 
Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home Program (NPLH), which requires the Department 
of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to award up to $2 billion to counties for the acquisition, design, construction, 
rehabilitation, or preservation of permanent supportive housing for individuals living with a severe mental illness who are 
homeless or at risk of chronic homelessness. Chapter 322, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1628) authorized CHFFA to enter into 
contracts with HCD and further authorized CHFFA to issue up to $2 billion in taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the NPLH 
Program. Chapter 41, Statutes of 2018 (AB 1827) placed the No Place Like Home program on the November 2018 ballot 
(Proposition 2), where it was adopted by the voters as the No Place Like Home Act. This ratified existing law establishing the 
No Place Like Home program as being consistent with the Mental Health Services Act approved through Proposition 63 in 
2004. It also ratified the issuance of up to $2 billion in previously authorized bonds.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD 
On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which 
allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can 
make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings. 
ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability 
expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the 
State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals. 
The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the 
purpose of creating the Program. CalABLE was officially launched in December of 2018 with the mission to meet the diverse 
needs of our customers and their families. CalABLE’s pledge is to be customer-driven, accountable, and a trusted partner in 
providing financial services. 
Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $15,000 during a taxable year, to a designated beneficiary's 
ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0900 - The Authority was established to issue up to $650 million in conduit financing to make loans or acquire title to property 
and to underwrite or undertake directly a variety of urban waterfront development projects within the coastal zone, the 
Sacramento-Yolo Port District, the Stockton Port District, and those metropolitan statistical areas meeting specified conditions. 
The Federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 requires that bonds authorized by the Authority generally be within an allocation from the 
state's ''private activity'' bond limit in order for the bonds to be federally tax-exempt, unless the issuer qualifies as a private, 
nonprofit business. 
Financing is available for both publicly and privately sponsored projects that provide visitor-serving facilities, waterfront-
dependent industries, public recreation, and erosion control facilities. The State Coastal Conservancy must approve both the

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM 
Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance 
of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to schools and 
community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities, 
reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB 
2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs. 
0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM 
Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program 
(CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the 
Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University 
Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50 
percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the 
state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be 
deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements. 
0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM 
In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded grants under the United States Department of Education's State Charter School 
Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs. 
Grant funds reimburse a charter school's costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities 
or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on 
preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, and 
demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. 
0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM 
The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and 
lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged

students. Eligible charter schools are provided the lesser of $1,232 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, or 75 percent 
of annual facilities rent and lease costs. 
0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND 
Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of 
up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is 
available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference is given to schools that 
have not opened nor completed their full charter term.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0940 - BOND FINANCING 
CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational 
facilities. Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms 
than might otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the 
construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or 
the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating 
institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private 
activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law. 
For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private 
college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's ethnicity, provided that the financing does not 
violate constitutional provisions. 
"Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to 
issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings than 
these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing. 
0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND 
Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the 
tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015, 
added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 
1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the tax 
credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.
