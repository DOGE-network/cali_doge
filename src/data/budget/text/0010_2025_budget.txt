Legislative, 
Judicial, and 
Executive 
Governmental bodies classified under the 
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive section of the 
Governor's Budget are either established as 
independent entities under the California 
Constitution, or are departments with a recognized 
need to operate outside of the administrative 
oversight and control of an agency secretary. 
Constitutionally-established bodies include the 
Legislature, Judicial Branch, Governor's Office, 
and constitutional officers. This section also 
includes such independent entities as the Office of 
the Inspector General and the California State 
Lottery Commission. 
0110   Senate 
The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. The State Senate is comprised of 40 members who are elected for 4-year terms. 
Members of the Legislature may serve a maximum of 12 years total in the Senate, the Assembly, or both, in any combination of 
terms. Members first elected before June 6, 2012, however, may generally serve a maximum of 14 years total, with no more 
than two terms in the Senate and three terms in the Assembly.

The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal 
and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee. 
Because the Legislature's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to 
support this need.  For the specifics on the Legislature's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was 
completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for 
construction of the Capitol Annex, which was completed in 1951 and housed legislative offices, committee rooms, and the 
Governor’s Office until it was demolished in 2023. 
Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored, 
rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects. Currently, a new Capitol Annex is 
under construction, and is expected to be completed in 2027.

0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System 
Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional 
officers, and legislative statutory officers. 
 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of 
its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,

disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions. The Legislators' 
Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 
 
Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November 
6, 1990. Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340) 
closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory 
officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

0160   Legislative Counsel Bureau 
The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal services to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members and 
committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process. The legal 
services furnished include rendering legal opinions, drafting bills and other legislative measures, counseling, attending 
meetings of legislative committees as counsel, and representing the Legislature in litigation. The Bureau also provides legal 
services to the Governor and advises state agencies as to the preparation of legislative measures. An attorney-client 
relationship is maintained and all work is confidential. 
In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative 
measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes. 
The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides technology services to the Legislature, including IT services 
in support of legislative business operations and the legislative information system, which provides information to the public 
regarding pending legislation and existing law. 
Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the 
Bureau. The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws recommended by the 
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these uniform acts. 
Pursuant to Chapter 450 of the Statutes of 2018, the Bureau provides advice and investigation services to the Legislature 
related to workplace misconduct through the Workplace Conduct Unit.

0250   Judicial Branch 
Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of 
the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. 
Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially 
unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 
The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent 
funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operations was 
implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This 
implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The 
county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty 
revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments 
to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted 
by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act 
of 2002 (Chapter 1082, Statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the 
counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial 
Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are 
deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of 
court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities 
based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 
The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, 
impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United 
States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 
Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the trial courts’ state 
funding in Section 1.
6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and 
Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" (Figure 2) amount used to calculate the 
total expenditures displayed for the "State Trial Court Funding Total."
7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences.  For the current year, this 
category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.
8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2023-24 and estimated expenditures for 2024-25 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2024-25 Enacted Budget.
4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Trial courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.

Total, State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts 
5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are 
transferred to the JBWCF. 
1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, and GF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state 
operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). Expenditures are rounded to the nearest thousand.
2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court 
Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial 
Courts" amount in this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1). 
4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of trial courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and 
Training (DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects the 
appropriated funds for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program (FFDRP).
3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid, excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" 
(Figure 1) revenue amounts reported ($157.135 million in 2023-24 and $184.745 million in 2024-25). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county 
is reimbursed by the TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2023-24 and 2024-25 participated in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the 
TCTF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0130 - SUPREME COURT 
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state 
courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the 
Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations 
for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of 
statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the 
Supreme Court. 
0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 
Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six 
District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the 
Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 
0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 
The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21 
voting members and 9 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as the 
administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation of 
the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and 
administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges, 
technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 
0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM 
The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of 
judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real 
estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction. 
0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING 
California has 58 trial courts, one in each county. In trial courts, or superior courts, a judge and sometimes a jury hears 
witnesses' testimony and other evidence and decides cases by applying the relevant law to the facts. Trial courts have trial 
jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases. To accomplish various statutory mandates, the State Trial Court Funding Program 
supports trial courts through the following programs: 
0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS 
This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and 
criminal cases. This program includes all allowable trial court administrative costs under Government Code section 77003. 
0150011 - COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNSEL 
This program provides funding for court-appointed counsel for children, non-minor dependents and parents in juvenile court 
dependency proceedings pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 317, subdivisions (b) and (c), and Government 
Code section 77003, subdivision (a)(4). 
0150019 - COMPENSATION OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES 
This program provides funding for the salaries and state benefits for Superior Court judges. 
0150028 - ASSIGNED JUDGES 
This program provides support for the salaries and related costs of retired as well as active judges who are assigned by the 
Chief Justice to positions in courts which require assistance due to judicial absences or other factors impacting the ability of a 
court to avoid case delay. 
0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS 
This program supports the provision of qualified language interpreters in criminal, juvenile, family, mental competency, 
Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Act, and civil proceedings as required by statute. 
0150046 - GRANTS 
This program provides funding for government grants providing public services related to the trial courts. 
0150051 – CHILD SUPPORT COMMISSIONER PROGRAM (AB 1058)

This program provides funding for Child Support Commissioners and Family Law Facilitators in every court. 
0150067 – COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE (CASA) PROGRAM 
This program provides funding for non-profits designated by the court to train and provide volunteers to advocate for children in 
foster care. 
0150083 – EQUAL ACCESS FUND 
This program provides funding to the Legal Services Trust Fund Commission of the State Bar of California to fund legal 
services programs to provide a range of services to low-income litigants. 
0150095 - EXPENSES ON BEHALF OF THE TRIAL COURT 
This program provides appropriation for statewide programs and services provided to the court or courts by the Judicial Council 
or payment for services or property of any kind contracted for the court or courts or on behalf of the courts by the Judicial 
Council, which are paid for or reimbursed by the trial courts. The appropriation also supports the implementation and 
administration of the Sargent Shriver Civil Counsel Pilot Program, which provides legal representation to low-income 
Californians on critical legal issues. 
In addition to the programs mentioned above, the State Trial Court Funding Program supports Children in Dependency Cases 
Training. 
0155 - HABEAS CORPUS RESOURCE CENTER 
The Habeas Corpus Resource Center provides legal representation for indigent petitioners in death penalty habeas corpus 
proceedings before the California state courts and the federal courts. The Center also serves as a resource center for the 
private capital defense bar, and it recruits and trains attorneys to expand the pool of private counsel qualified to accept 
appointments in death penalty habeas corpus proceedings, and thereby helps to reduce the number of unrepresented indigents 
on California's death row.

0280   Commission on Judicial Performance 
The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of 
judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California 
Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of 
California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or 
resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees. 
In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement. 
The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial 
misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation 
and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal 
from office. 
The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the 
Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,

and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms. 
Commission members do not receive a salary.

0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and 
Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement 
System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members. 
The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in 
1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System 
II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final 
compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement 
System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of 
contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined 
benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II is funded 
through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. The state's contributions are adjusted 
annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund. 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, 
compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges 
and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing 
fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit 
payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the 
required benefit payments to retired judges. 
 
Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 
2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

0552   Office of the Inspector General 
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional 
system. OIG is responsible for providing contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation's (CDCR) internal affairs investigations; use of force; staff complaints, including complaints involving sexual 
misconduct; and the employee disciplinary process. Consistent with legislation chaptered in 2024, OIG may investigate 
complaints into allegations of staff sexual misconduct filed by incarcerated persons under certain circumstances. OIG audits 
and reviews the policies, practices, and procedures of CDCR. OIG reviews the Governor's candidates for appointment to serve 
as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review 
delivery of medical care at each state prison. OIG receives communications from individuals alleging improper governmental 
activity and maintains a toll-free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; 
conducts formal reviews of complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper management where a legally 
cognizable cause of action is present; and reviews sexual abuse incidents within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical 
public transparency for the state correctional system by publicly reporting its findings. 
In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (C-ROB) that examines CDCR's various mental 
health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for incarcerated individuals and parolees. C-ROB meets at 
least twice annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of rehabilitation and treatment programs. C-ROB 
also submits annual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of 
treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of incarcerated individuals and individuals on parole, gaps in rehabilitation services, and 
levels of participation and success.

0650   Governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation 
The Governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation assists the Governor and the Administration in planning, research, 
policy development, and legislative analysis. The Office formulates long-range state goals and policies to address key areas 
related to climate, land use, and innovation: land use and planning, climate risk and resilience, environmental protection, 
sustainable economic development, and targeted long-range research needs. The Office acts as the state's liaison to a variety 
of entities including local and regional government, planning professionals, small business, academic institutions, tribal nations, 
and the federal government. The Office also serves a role as convener across multiple state agencies on cross-cutting issues 
in the four key areas of their work. 
 
The Office includes two main budget programs: the State Planning and Policy Development that houses most of core planning 
and research functions, as well as the Racial Equity Commission and the California Strategic Growth Council, which 
coordinates and works collaboratively with public agencies, communities, and key partners to realize healthy, thriving, resilient 
communities for all and provides direct grant funding to projects demonstrating the value and feasibility of sustainable 
communities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0372 - CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS 
California Volunteers is tasked with engaging Californians in service, volunteering and civic action to tackle the state’s most 
pressing challenges while lifting up all communities. The California Service Corps consists of the CaliforniansForAll College 
Corps, Youth Service Corps, California Climate Action Corps, and AmeriCorps California. From the California Climate Action 
Corps, the country’s first state-led climate corps program, to the CaliforniansForAll volunteer initiative launched in response to 
COVID-19 to establish a volunteer corps to support the state’s response to emergencies and disasters, California Volunteers 
plays an integral role in addressing the state’s problems. California Volunteers is supported by a bipartisan 25-member 
Commission and a team of experts driven by a mission to empower and mobilize all Californians to volunteer and serve in their 
communities.  
California Volunteers also houses the Youth Empowerment Commission that engages youth directly with policymakers 
providing meaningful opportunities for civic engagement to improve the quality of life for California’s underserved and 
marginalized youth. The 13 voting commissioners aged 14 to 25, appointed by the Governor and other state officials examine 
and discuss policy and fiscal issues affecting the interests, needs, and conditions of the youth of California. The Commission 
formally advises and makes recommendations to the Legislature, Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Governor on 
specific legislative and fiscal issues affecting youth.  
0373 - OFFICE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS 
The Office of Community Partnerships and Strategic Communications is a single state entity coordinating California’s most 
important statewide public awareness and community outreach efforts, which allows the state to realize more inclusive and 
effective outcomes while preventing equity gaps in statewide outreach. With the unprecedented scale of the challenges 
California is facing, the state must be able to communicate effectively with all Californians, including those who are 
experiencing the greatest health and social inequities. The tested model of an ecosystem of trusted messengers builds on the 
success of Census 2020 and Vaccinate ALL 58 campaigns. The Office implements micro-targeted public education and 
communication efforts to benefit under-served Californians. The Office’s tested model of State-CBO outreach collaboration 
employs a result-based management system to: 1) implement data-driven and qualitative analysis for accountability, 
evaluation, and resource allocations; 2) analyze data trends to identify communities of concern and monitor outputs; 3) fund 
community-based organizations to address access and inclusion through relevant cultural and in-language materials and 
tactics; 4) execute integrated media campaigns to reach targeted populations and collaborating with media, including ethnic 
media, to dispel misinformation; 5) coordinate with state and public agencies, elected representatives, faith-based 
organizations, philanthropy, and other civil society groups to leverage resources and expand impact.

0690   Office of Emergency Services 
The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency 
response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's 
Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's 
homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, 
protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats. 
Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal 
agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in 
emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own 
resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the 
federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California. 
During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's 
responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal 
assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the 
development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes 
prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 
Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and 
the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS 
assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of and response to criminal and terrorist activity and also facilitates 
information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission is a separate unit within the Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to 
lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well 
as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management. 
Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
 
Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program 
coordinates the provision of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended 
in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-
hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National 
Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this 
program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to 
all hazards. 
0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 
Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services 
grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland 
Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency 
management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant 
management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with 
financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the 
centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion 
center. 
0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent 
earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s 
progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.  The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate, 
and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.  The 
Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support 
the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.  These activities include: (1) developing and 
reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related 
legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies, 
where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and 
supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery. 
0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 
The Public Safety Communications program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the 
state's public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The program is dedicated to the 
preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that 
keep the public connected during times of crisis. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE 
The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of Cal OES and support services such as 
accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.

† Savings resulting from SEC. 4.05 and/or SEC. 4.12 of the 2024 Budget Act are currently being recorded as an unallocated 
statewide set-aside. As a result, this department’s budgetary displays may reflect overstated expenditures and may also 
potentially reflect negative fund balances in particular programs and funds. Fiscal year 2023-24 budget display reflects the best 
available information for use in decision-making for this department and/or these fund(s). Additional review and reconciliation of 
2023-24 ending fund balances will occur in the spring to evaluate if a budget adjustment is required.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0435 - LEGAL SERVICES 
Legal Services is organized into five elements: (1) Civil Law, (2) Criminal Law, (3) Public Rights, (4) Medi-Cal and Elder Abuse, 
and (5) Office of General Counsel. 
Civil Law represents the State of California and its officers, agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and employees in 
civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them, prosecutes cases to vindicate state 
interests, and conducts investigations. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases 
before administrative tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the 
United States and California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of nine sections: Business Litigation; Cannabis Control; 
Correctional Law; Employment Law; Government Law; Health, Education, and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement; Licensing; 
and Tort and Condemnation. 
Criminal Law represents the People of the State of California in criminal matters before the appellate and Supreme Courts. 
Criminal Law also fulfills the Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are 
recused, conducting criminal investigations, representing the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole 
decisions and conditions of confinement in the state prisons, and defending criminal judgements in state and federal habeas 
corpus matters. Additional responsibilities include enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition 
matters, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving white-collar crimes, high-tech/computer/privacy 
crimes, financial crimes, human trafficking, environmental crimes, public corruption, organized retail theft, and officer-involved 
shootings. The newly created Post-Conviction Justice Unit is charged with handling matters involving resentencing and 
conviction review. 
Public Rights protects and preserves the public’s interests by providing legal services to state agencies, boards and 
commissions, and Constitutional Officers, by engaging in policy advocacy and filing amicus curiae briefs, and by bringing 
actions in the Attorney General’s independent capacity and in the name of the People of the State of California to protect the 
public. Public Rights has specialized expertise, as well as litigation and enforcement capabilities, in the following areas:

Antitrust Law, Nonprofit and Charitable Trust Enforcement and Regulation (including the Registry of Charities and Fundraisers); 
Civil Rights Enforcement (including the Bureaus of Children's Justice, Racial Justice, and Disability Rights); Consumer 
Protection (including Privacy Enforcement and Sellers of Travel); Corporate Fraud (including False Claims and Corporate

The Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse represents the People of the State of California in both criminal and civil 
matters involving Medi-Cal provider fraud, and the abuse or neglect of elder and dependent adults and Medi-Cal recipients. 
The Division is a vertical prosecution unit whose investigations are conducted by multidisciplinary teams consisting of Special 
Agents, Investigative Auditors, Digital Forensic Specialists, Registered Nurses, and Deputy Attorneys General. Deputy 
Attorneys General from the Division represent the People of the State of California in both federal and state courts. Types of 
cases frequently prosecuted by the Division include fraud committed against the Medi-Cal program by doctors, pharmacies, 
clinics, dentists, medical equipment suppliers, hospice, home health companies, and all other Medi-Cal providers; elder or 
dependent adult abuse or neglect in skilled nursing facilities, residential care facilities for the elderly, intermediate care facilities 
for the developmentally disabled, and other specified residential care facilities; and the neglect or abuse of Medi-Cal recipients 
in non-institutional settings, when such abuse or neglect is connected to the provision of case. 
The Office of General Counsel serves as a single point of contact for legal advice to the Department of Justice’s various 
programs and bureaus, as well as coordinates and oversees legal compliance and risk-management efforts across the 
Department. Key areas of legal work include information security and data storage and disclosure; law-enforcement operations; 
contracting, agreements, and grants; professional ethics; financial conflicts and other government ethics requirements; 
regulations; the Public Records Act; the Administrative Procedure Act; the Bagley-Keene Act’s open meeting requirements; and 
public finance. Attorneys within this division also lead or support internal investigations, operational projects that further 
Departmental risk-management and compliance missions, and the development and implementation of policies and procedures 
within the Department. Also within the Office of General Counsel are the Office of Program Oversight and Accountability, as 
well as the Office of Information Security and Research Services, which provides cybersecurity direction and policy guidance 
on information security and privacy matters, and research services for the Department. 
0440 - LAW ENFORCEMENT 
The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five areas: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3) 
Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief. 
The Bureau of Firearms (BOF) implements and enforces California's firearms and ammunition laws by administering a 
multitude of different state-mandated firearms and ammunition-related programs. This is accomplished by conducting firearm 
and ammunition eligibility checks, conducting compliance inspections of firearm dealers, ammunition vendors, and 
manufacturers, and by providing valuable training to stakeholders statewide. BOF Special Agents conduct investigations into 
armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of firearms, magazines, and ammunition. Finally, 
BOF Special Agents conduct investigations to monitor and prevent illegal firearms trafficking at permitted gun shows in 
accordance with state and federal laws. 
The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and scientific analysis of physical evidence, crime scene 
investigation, and scientific investigative support for officer-involved shooting investigations. Additionally, BFS provides expert 
court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts. BFS operates 10 regional 
crime laboratories and two specialized laboratories, the Jan Bashinski DNA Laboratory, and the Statewide Toxicology 
Laboratory. These laboratories serve 46 of California’s 58 counties. BFS also operates the California Criminalistics Institute 
forensic training facility that provides training for forensic scientists worldwide. Finally, BFS maintains the state DNA database, 
which stores and regularly searches the DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees against the DNA 
profiles of evidence from unsolved crimes. 
The Bureau of Gambling Control (BGC) regulates California cardrooms and tribal casinos to ensure gambling is conducted 
honestly and is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of 
individuals and business entities who apply for licenses and by monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance 
with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. BGC also encompasses an audit component to ensure solvency in 
gambling establishments and provides investigative audit expertise. BGC conducts criminal investigations in and around tribal 
casinos and California cardrooms. In addition, BGC conducts Compact Compliance reviews for tribal gaming to ensure that 
each tribe is in compliance with all aspects of the state gaming compact. 
The Bureau of Investigation (BI) investigates and dismantles criminal organizations and assists with the prosecution of serious 
criminal offenses that present a significant and multi-jurisdictional threat to California. BI prioritizes investigations related to 
transnational criminal enterprises involved in gangs, as well as cases involving major white-collar fraud, underground economy, 
recycling fraud, officer-involved shootings, homicides, foreign prosecution, and human trafficking and sexual predator 
apprehension crimes. In addition, BI serves a principal role in providing leadership, coordination, and support to law 
enforcement through intelligence support centers and multi-agency task forces focusing on violent offenders, gangs, and major 
crimes statewide.

The Office of the Chief (Office) provides leadership and administrative guidance to the investigative, regulatory, and forensic 
programs within the Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies. The Office is DOJ’s executive law 
enforcement’s liaison focal point, statewide. The Office serves as the policymaking and oversight body for its four operational 
bureaus. The Office also includes the Office of Gun Violence Prevention (OGVP) to support the DOJ’s ongoing efforts to 
reduce and prevent gun violence, firearm injury, and related trauma. 
0445 - CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES 
The California Justice Information Services Division provides criminal justice intelligence, information, and identification 
services to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the public. Four major functional areas carry out these primary services: 
(1) The Justice Data and Investigative Services Bureau offers investigative and field services functions to criminal justice, 
public safety, and regulatory agencies. Information and technical assistance are provided on a variety of manual and 
automated systems, including the Stop Data Collection System, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation 
System, the Criminal Justice Statistics Center, the California Sex and Arson Registry, and other person and property databases 
used daily by state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies; (2) The Bureau of Criminal Information and Analysis 
consolidates the functions related to biometric services housed in the California Identification System for retaining and 
positively identifying finger, palm, and latent images; as well as, storage and dissemination of state summary criminal history 
information for law enforcement and regulatory purposes; (3) The Hawkins Data Center operates the Criminal Justice 
Information System and the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, as well as provides IT services for the 
Division of Law Enforcement and the Attorney General’s Office; (4) the Operations Support Program provides business 
resumption planning and administrative support and oversight. 
9900 - DIRECTORATE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Directorate and the Administration Division of the Department of Justice consists of the Attorney General's Executive 
Office and the Division of Operations. The Executive Office maintains the overall direction and administration of the diverse 
programs and projects of the department, including the Equal Employment Rights and Resolution Office, the Opinions Unit, the 
Solicitor General's Office, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Office of Communications, the Public Inquiry Unit, and the Office 
of Community Awareness, Response, and Engagement. In addition, the Division of Operations provides support functions

0840   State Controller 
The State Controller is the chief fiscal officer of California. Principally responsible for transparency and accountability of the 
state's financial resources, the Controller ensures the appropriate disbursement and tracking of taxpayer dollars. The Controller 
serves on dozens of state boards, commissions, and committees with duties ranging from administrative oversight of the 
nation's two largest public pension funds, to protection of state lands and coastlines, to modernization and financing of major 
infrastructure. The Controller also offers fiscal guidance to local governments and has independent auditing authority over 
government agencies related to the spending of state funds. The Controller's primary objectives are to: 
• Account for and control disbursement of all state funds, issuing warrants in payment of the state's bills. 
• Determine legality and accuracy of financial claims against the state. 
• Audit state and local government programs and agencies. 
• Ensure businesses report and remit unclaimed property in compliance with Unclaimed Property Law and safeguard remitted 
unclaimed property until claimed by the rightful owners or heirs. 
• Inform the public of the state's financial condition. 
• Inform the public of financial transactions of city, county, and other local governments. 
• Administer the Uniform State Payroll System. 
• Audit and process all personnel and payroll transactions for state civil service, state exempt employees, California State 
University employees, and Judicial Council employees.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0500100 - ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING 
The State Accounting and Reporting Division maintains uniform and systematic control accounts of all receipts, payments, 
appropriations, state fund balances, and bonded indebtedness; monitors the cash flow of the General Fund; administers the 
statewide discharge from accountability program; participates in offsetting monies owed to the state; reports the financial 
condition of the state; and collaborates with the Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, and the Department of General 
Services to develop and implement the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal) to ensure the system meets the 
state's primary objectives and provides best business practices for the state. 
The Local Government Programs and Services Division maintains a database of information and reports on local financial 
transactions and government compensation; apportions shared revenues to local governments; administers local mandated 
and non-mandated cost reimbursement programs; approves county cost allocation plans; prescribes uniform accounting

procedures for counties, special districts, and trial court revenues; plans and facilitates an annual conference with county 
auditors; administers and collects estate and inheritance taxes; collects delinquent insurance and motor vehicle fuel taxes, 
petroleum and gas assessments, and trial court penalties; refunds gasoline taxes paid on fuel consumed for off-highway 
purposes; instructs and advises county tax collectors; approves state and local government requests to participate in the 
Interagency Intercept Collection Program; collects recorder fees from counties pursuant to the Building Homes and Jobs Act, 
(Chapter 364, Statutes of 2017); and administers the Property Tax Postponement Program for seniors and people who are 
blind or have a disability. 
0500200 - AUDITS 
The Audits Division determines the legality and accuracy of all claims against the state through the performance of prepayment 
audits; assures the accuracy of local government claims and financial statements submitted to the state and federal 
governments by establishing and updating audit guidelines, and reviewing audits performed by independent auditors; performs 
field audits for state and federal programs; reviews the single audit reports of local governments and local education agencies 
that receive pass-through federal funds from state agencies; and audits major businesses for compliance with the Unclaimed 
Property Law. 
0500300 - PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL SERVICES 
 
The Personnel and Payroll Services Division (PPSD) processes payroll and leave accounting for all state civil service and 
exempt employees, state court, and California State University employees. PPSD provides information required to manage the 
personnel resources of the state and to properly account for salary and wage expenditures, provides data to the retirement 
systems necessary for calculation of employee retirement benefits, and manages the state’s automated travel expense 
reimbursement system. 
Cal Employee Connect (CEC) and ConnectHR are SCO’s secure web-based customer service portals for state employees and 
human resources staff, respectively. They were developed as interim solutions to provide some of the enhancements the 
California State Payroll System Project (CSPS) will deliver when completed, to support a hybrid remote workforce and make 
personnel and payroll transactions more efficient and paperless. 
The CSPS Project was initiated to modernize the statewide human resource management, travel and business expense, and 
payroll systems as part of a fully integrated solution. The system should enable the state to improve management processes 
and fulfill its payroll, reporting, and deduction processing obligations accurately and on time. 
0500400 - UNCLAIMED PROPERTY 
 
The Unclaimed Property Division administers the Unclaimed Property Law by providing one central source for rightful owners to 
claim their property; notifying owners of their unclaimed property before it is transferred to the state; receiving unclaimed 
property from banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, and other businesses; and providing outreach and education for 
businesses holding unclaimed property. 
0500500 - DISBURSEMENTS 
The Disbursements Bureau produces and distributes all payments of the state's obligations after auditing and clearance 
through control accounts.  Examples of some of the state's payments are personal income tax refunds, payroll, vendor 
payments, in-home supportive services and retirement payments. Disbursements also provides post-issuance services, 
including disposition of undeliverable warrants, lost warrant duplication, processing of claims of forgery, and maintenance and 
production of paid warrant images. 
0500900 - DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive Office and Administration functions include Budgets, Business Services, Contracts and Procurement, 
Departmental Accounting, and Human Resources all of which provide executive direction and support services to all divisions 
within SCO. 
The Information Systems Division (ISD) develops, maintains, and operates all of the department's mainframe, client-server, and 
web-based systems; and oversees the planning, procurement, use, and maintenance of information technology hardware and 
software. Within ISD, the Information Security Office evaluates security compliance, internal control management, and security 
governance.

0845   Department of Insurance 
California's elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the second largest insurance market in the world with insurance 
companies collecting more than $400 billion in premiums annually in California while protecting consumers and ensuring the 
health and sustainability of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is “Innovative 
Insurance Protection for All Californians.” CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting 
consumers in their dealings with insurance companies, and enhancing business processes to better address emerging and 
future challenges as well as improving services for insurance producers, consumers, and businesses. 
CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, CDI oversees and licenses more than 
1,400 insurance companies and more than 515,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents, brokers, adjusters, 
and bail agents and annually issues approximately 260,000 licenses (new and renewals). Additionally, CDI receives and 
investigates approximately 305,000 consumer inquiries and complaints annually, performs hundreds of ongoing risk-focused 
financial surveillances and market conduct examinations of insurance companies, receives approximately 20,000 suspected 
fraudulent claim referrals and investigates approximately 1,200 of those referrals, receives and reviews approximately 5,200 
rate filing applications annually, and works in conjunction with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate 
and prosecute fraudulent insurance practices.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0520 - REGULATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCERS 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to make sure they can provide 
the benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and 
underlying assumptions to ensure transparency and consistency in models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by 
insurance companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty 
insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the California Insurance Code 
and the California Code of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance

sector; (6) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance 
companies to get unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases 
are actuarially justified and not excessive; (8) perform market conduct reviews to ensure compliance; and (9) ensure that 
applicants for insurance licenses and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. 
Additionally, CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies through the Conservation and 
Liquidation Office. 
0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders 
and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or 
underwriting by insurers and producers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent 
practices and from incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved 
and historically disadvantaged communities; and (4) assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community 
service organizations, and neighborhood associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed 
informational guides, workshops, seminars, roundtables, and town halls. 
0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 
The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for 
prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace 
officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the 
Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition, 
the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower “qui tam” actions seeking civil penalties against 
perpetrators of insurance fraud. 
0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE 
This program performs tax collection, ensures the compliance of insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws 
contained in the Insurance Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and 
Fee Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the 
premium tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

0850   California State Lottery Commission 
In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an 
initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it 
broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to 
benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by 
the State Senate. 
The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34 
percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be 
used for administrative costs.

LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost 
limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of 
contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery 
Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily 
Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the 
University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 
In the 38 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2024, the California State Lottery has raised $46.1 billion 
for public education, including approximately $2.3 billion in 2023-24. 
Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2024-25 and 2025-26 cannot be made 
with certainty.

0855   California Gambling Control Commission 
The mission of the California Gambling Control Commission (Commission) is to protect the public by ensuring integrity and 
justice in California's controlled gambling industry through effective regulations and fair application of the law. The Commission 
has jurisdiction over gambling establishments (cardrooms), third-party providers of proposition player services, and certain 
aspects of Tribal casinos, pursuant to its authority under state law and Tribal-State Gaming Compacts (Compacts). The 
Commission also has jurisdiction over gaming policies, regulations, criteria, and standards. 
There are 80 licensed cardrooms in California over which the Commission has broad regulatory and adjudicatory authority. This 
authority extends to the operation, concentration, and supervision of the cardrooms and all persons and things related to each 
licensed establishment. 
The Commission has fiduciary, regulatory, and administrative responsibilities related to Tribal gaming that include: (1) 
distributing specified Tribal gaming revenues to Non-Compact, Non-Gaming and Limited-Gaming Tribes; (2) making suitability 
determinations for key employees, gaming resource suppliers, and financial sources; and (3) serving as the administrator of the 
Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, and the Tribal Nation Grant Fund.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0700 - FILINGS AND REGISTRATIONS 
The Business Programs Division is comprised of three primary areas: Business Entities, Uniform Commercial Code, and 
Notary Public and Special Filings. 
Business Entities examines, files, and maintains formation documents for new California business entities and qualifies out-of-
state and international entities to conduct business in California; and also examines, files and maintains changes to the records 
of domestic or qualified foreign business entities to ensure the business entities are properly formed, merged, converted, 
amended, and dissolved in compliance with California law. Statements of Information containing key officers and contact 
information are also processed and maintained for public and governmental use. 
Uniform Commercial Code files certain financing statements allowing lending institutions to protect their financial interest in 
personal property and established priority in case of debtor default or bankruptcy. Notices of judgment liens, attachment liens, 
agricultural liens, and equipment liens are also filed in Uniform Commercial Code, as well as notices of various tax liens 
submitted by state and federal taxing agencies such as the Franchise Tax Board and the Internal Revenue Service. 
Notary Public and Special Filings appoints and commissions qualified notaries public for four- year terms, reviews and 
approves notary public education courses, and certifies to the authenticity of signatures of notaries public and public officials on 
documents for use in foreign countries. Special Filings include trademarks and service marks as well as surety bonds that 
certain business entities are required to file, notices of joint power agreements, city and county charters, and claims for 
successor-in-interest. This area also has disciplinary functions with regard to notaries public and immigration consultants.

treatment preferences if he/she cannot speak or make decisions for him/herself. The AHCD also may designate someone else 
to make decisions regarding medical treatment. AHCDs and related information can be provided upon request to the 
registrant's health care provider, public guardian, or legal representative. 
The Domestic Partners Registry registers same-sex couples regardless of the age of the partners, and opposite-sex couples in 
which one partner is at least 62 years old, as domestic partners in California. 
The Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund provides limited restitution to victims of corporate fraud who are unable to 
collect through other means on a judgment against a corporation for corporate fraud. 
Safe at Home is the State's confidential address program designed to assist: (1) victims and survivors of domestic violence and 
human trafficking, sexual assault, stalking, and elder/dependent adult abuse; (2) reproductive health care employees, patients, 
and volunteers who are in fear for their safety because of their affiliation with a health care facility; (3) public entity employees 
and contractors who are in fear for their safety because of their work for a public entity; and (4) their household members and 
minor children. Participants in the Safe at Home program are provided with a post office box to use as a substitute mailing 
address, thereby allowing them to keep their actual residential address confidential. Once enrolled into the program, Safe at 
Home  provides a mail forwarding service and assists participants who qualify with additional confidential services offered by 
various state and local agencies. 
0705 - ELECTIONS 
 
The Secretary of State serves as California’s chief elections officer and has broad responsibility to administer and oversee 
federal and state elections held within California. The Elections Program maintains the official statewide database of registered 
voters, tracks and certifies ballot measures, certifies candidates for placement on the ballot, and certifies official election 
results. In addition, the program oversees the certification and modernization of voting equipment and the enhancement of 
election processes. The program works to increase accessibility to voters, provides resources to educate voters on the 
electoral system, and investigates election related criminal violations as provided by the California Elections Code. 
This program includes the campaign and lobbying registration and disclosure provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974. 
Under this law, the Office registers all levels of campaign committees, and reviews for compliance with statutory requirements 
all state-level candidate and campaign recipient committees, major donors, slate mailer, political party, and independent 
expenditure committees. The program registers lobbyists (including placement agents), lobbying firms and lobbyist employers, 
reviews for compliance with statutory requirements the periodic financial disclosure reports filed by lobbying entities, and 
publishes a Lobbying Directory on the Internet. This program also supports the electronic filing requirements of the Political 
Reform Act and posts relevant registration and disclosure information to the Office's web site so the public can track where 
campaign money is raised and spent and what lobbying activity is occurring in state government. A searchable database of 
campaign and lobbying financial activity is also provided through the web site. 
0710 - ARCHIVES 
The California State Archives establishes and administers a records management program that applies efficient and 
economical management methods to the creation, utilization, maintenance, retention, preservation, and disposal of state 
records and acquires, indexes, preserves, and provides reference access to irreplaceable historic materials from the three 
branches of state government. The Archives acquires physical and electronic records with legal, administrative, or evidentiary 
value, or that have historical significance. Materials are transferred to the Archives for permanent preservation. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program develops and manages overall policy. It serves as the liaison to other state agencies, the Legislature, the federal 
government, and other states' Secretaries of State. This program responds to constituent correspondence and requests from 
the public and advocates in the Legislature, administers the Secretary's role as a member of the National Association of 
Secretaries of State, in the management of task forces and advisory committees, in the implementation of new federal and 
state statutory requirements, and coordinates and disseminates information about the Office and its initiatives to the public. 
This program also monitors elections cybersecurity incidents and promotes transparency in alerting the public regarding false 
election websites and information as well as providing oversight on cybersecurity risk management. It also provides the Office 
with the necessary personnel, general administrative, budgeting, fiscal services, and information technology expertise to plan, 
develop, implement, and operate innovative and effective business and information systems solutions.

Fish and Wildlife, the state's retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a 
voluntary investment program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the 
PMIB program. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, 2,341 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $21.8 billion for

0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 
In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System 
(CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires 
the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB, 
giving the PMIB the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits, 
and loans to the General Fund. 
The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of 
the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that 
the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer 
maintains demand bank accounts with seven banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for 
the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 
The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts 
available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer 
of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks, 5) redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for 
payment, 6) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities 
pledged to the state, 7) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state as collateral for the time, demand, 
and other state agency programs, and 8) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by 
or pledged to the state. 
0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE 
The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes, 
revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The 
Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to 
bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 
The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse 
consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance includes monitoring 
the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and 
ensuring proper record keeping. 
0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 
services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems, 
business services, technical support, and production operations.

0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee 
The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State 
of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit, 
such as the creation of affordable housing. 
The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual 
basis. The bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by multiplying the state population by $125 in 2024; a factor determined 
by the IRS each year. California's limit totaled over $4.87 billion in 2024. 
The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers 
authorities and state agencies. The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the state 
or federal government. 
The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of six members, including three voting members and three 
advisors. The voting members are the State Treasurer (Chairperson of the Committee), the Governor, and the State Controller 
or their designee. The non-voting (advisory) members are the Director of Housing and Community Development, the Executive 
Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and a representative from local government selected by two voting 
members.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
The Committee administers various programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity 
bonds. Below is a summary of each program: 
Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost to develop multifamily rental 
housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers produce 
affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and families. To 
qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or reserve at 
least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can apply for 
four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit Allocation Committee Joint 
Application. 
Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance any of the following facilities identified by the IRS 
as an exempt facility, including but not limited to: solid waste disposal and waste recycling facilities, mass commuting facilities, 
high-speed rail, energy and power generating facilities, and sustainable design facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the 
project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to 
protect and enhance the environment.

Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates to assist first-time 
homebuyers with purchasing homes. Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, 
condominiums, or townhouses. Program participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the 
program's purchase price limitations. 
Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds 
issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and 
midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their 
communities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
The Federal Program 
Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax 
incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise 
project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and 
indexed for inflation. 
Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the 
percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability 
annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of 
the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project 
sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each 
year for a ten-year period. 
The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation. For 2024, each 
state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.90 per state resident. Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share 
of unused credits in a national pool. 
Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects 
must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there 
is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. 
Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires 
maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance. 
The State LIHTC Program 
In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the 
federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for 
an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax 
credit status.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2024, is more than $122.6 million. Investors take the state tax 
credit annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period. 
Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and the California Debt Limit 
Allocation Committee to issue an additional $500 million in state low-income housing tax credits in 2020 to be paired with 4% 
federal low-income housing tax credits and tax-exempt bonds to bolster new construction of low-income housing. Per AB 101, 
this $500 million tax credit was issued for calendar years beginning in 2020, and for calendar years beginning in 2021 pursuant 
to an authorization in the annual Budget Act or related legislation. 
Farmworker Housing Program 
Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state 
LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017, 
these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and 
projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase. 
Beginning in 2024 through 2034 calendar year, AB 1654 allocates the lesser of 5% or $25,000,000 of the $500,000,000 state 
low-income housing tax credits to be set aside for farmworker housing. 
State Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits 
SB 451 authorized $50,000,000 in historic tax credits per calendar year, for a five-year period, beginning in 2021. These tax 
credits are allocated by California Tax Credit Allocation Committee in conjunction with and upon approval from the Office of 
Historic Preservation.

0971   California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing 
Authority 
The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes 
of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently 
utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the 
environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources, 
implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and 
lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit 
enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities 
needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies. 
The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director 
of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, 
and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the 
Authority, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as determined and 
approved by resolution of the Authority. 
The Authority is a conduit issuer of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance local district heating or cooling facilities, and 
private activity bonds for 501(c)(3) non-profits. Past issuances total more than $212 million in bond financing for green projects 
in California. 
In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative 
source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010). The STE program expanded (Chapter 677, Statutes of

2012) to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 768, Statutes 
of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock and equipment 
that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of 2019, extended 
the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job creation-related criteria 
by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. In 2022, Chapter 251, Statutes of 2022, authorized CAEATFA an additional 
$15 million per calendar year in STE for specific lithium projects for years 2022 to 2024. The objective of this program is to 
promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and high road jobs and training that are aimed at reducing 
greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, and energy consumption. 
Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013 
(Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority 
developed a loan loss reserve program for residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and a risk 
mitigation program for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs in California. A program to support low-
interest financing of PACE efficiency projects in commercial buildings is in discussion. 
 
The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in 
collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to develop and launch energy efficiency financing pilot 
programs to encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the residential and commercial sectors). Now known 
collectively as GoGreen Financing, these established programs employ various types of credit enhancements, lower costs and 
expand access to capital for Californians making energy efficiency improvements to help achieve the state's energy efficiency 
and decarbonization goals. Authorization to also allow clean energy and demand response measures was received from the 
PUC in 2023 and implemented in 2024. Furthermore, additional funding sources to expand access to energy, demand 
response and clean energy efficiency improvements have been secured to allow projects statewide.

0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority 
California Pollution Control Financing Authority (CPCFA) is dedicated to helping businesses access capital for projects that 
support state and federal environmental and economic objectives. Initially focused on pollution control, CPCFA has evolved to 
include a broad range of programs that foster sustainable development, support small businesses, and revitalize communities. 
Created in 1972, CPCFA originated as a conduit issuer of tax-exempt bonds for control of air and water pollution and now 
assists the organic and inorganic solid waste/recycling, water supply, wastewater, and carbon dioxide capture industries 
through its Private Activity Tax-Exempt Bond Program. Over the last 50 years, CPCFA evolved to include financing programs 
assisting California's small business sector through its California Capital Access Program (CalCAP), the California Investment 
and Innovation Program (Cal IIP), and to promote the reuse and redevelopment of brownfields through the California Recycle 
Underutilized Sites Program (CALReUSE). 
The CPCFA Board consists of the following members: State Treasurer (Chair), the State Controller, and the Director of the 
Department of Finance.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM 
CPCFA’s Tax-Exempt Private Activity Bond (PAB) program helps private companies, non-profits, and public/private 
partnerships (PPPs) access public finance markets by issuing tax-exempt bonds for qualified projects. CPCFA administers 
categories defined by federal and state law, including solid waste, water furnishing, wastewater, and carbon dioxide capture. 
Borrowers use this program to achieve lower interest rates compared to commercial lending or to secure project-based 
financing that might otherwise be unavailable. 
In addition, CPCFA maintains a Small Business Assistance Fund (SBAF) that provides cost of issuance financial assistance to 
qualified small business borrowers. 
Tax-exempt financing issued by CPCFA assists communities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California 
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, and more recently, Assembly 
Bill 1826 (Chesbro, Chapter 727, Statutes of 2014), and Senate Bill 1383 (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016). From 1974 
through June 30, 2024, CPCFA issued bonds totaling approximately $17.4 billion 
0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
Established in 1994, CalCAP provides credit enhancement to encourage financial institutions to lend to small businesses. 
CalCAP operates through two primary mechanisms: loan loss reserve and cash pledge, both of which reduce lender risk and 
expand access to capital. The program has evolved over the years to include multiple variants, including state and federally 
funded programs, as well as specialized initiatives in partnership with independent contributors. Prior to 2010, CalCAP was 
entirely self-funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA’s Small Business Assistance Fund (SBAF), established with fees 
collected from large companies issuing debt through CPCFA's tax-exempt bond program. In October 2010 CalCAP received $6 
million from the state's General Fund (Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010) to increase lending efforts. The $6 million appropriation 
was fully- expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual recapture of contributions to become the primary source for the 
State's contributions. 
In 2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from the U.S. Treasury's State 
Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI 1.0). CPCFA shared the allocation with the Infrastructure and Economic Development 
Bank (IBank), now housed within the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). 
These funds enabled CPCFA to expand the availability of its CalCAP for Small Business (CalCAP SB). In addition, CPCFA 
launched the Collateral Support Program (CSP) in 2013 to further offset financial institution’s resistance to lend after the 2008 
recession. CPCFA created the CSP with a recapture provision allowing for the sustainability of the program. 
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
0974   California Pollution Control Financing Authority - Continued
2025-26 GOVERNOR'S BUDGET — LJE 241
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The federal government ended the SSBCI 1.0 program in 2017. At the request of the U.S. Treasury, CalCAP SB instituted an 
annual recapture provision to provide sustainability beyond the active federal funding. 
In 2021, the federal government reauthorized the funding of SSBCI (SSBCI 2.0). CPCFA and IBank partnered again to apply 
for SSBCI 2.0 allocation and equally share the $1.181 billion allocated to California. Funding will be received in three tranches. 
Recapture for the CalCAP SB program has been suspended for the SSBCI 2.0 program, and other features have been 
enhanced to further engage financial institutions in lending to small businesses. 
0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM 
The California Recycle Underutilized Sites (CALReUSE) program assisted with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized 
properties with real or perceived contamination issues. CALReUSE addressed a funding and information gap in the 
development of contaminated properties (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, 
the CALReUSE Assessment Program provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000 which was later increased to $500,000 per 
brownfield site. The funds assisted with brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the 
development of remedial action plans. Eligible projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped 
due to lack of information about real or perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time 
frames and the regulatory process. 
Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund 
brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received 
$60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project for brownfield remediation that 
promoted affordable infill residential and mixed-used developments. Three projects were pre-approved to receive awards of 
more than $5 million; one grant was increased above $5 million when returned funds became available. All CALReUSE 
Program funds have been awarded and CPCFA continues to monitor and administer open grants to ensure compliance and 
completion. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites in 30 California communities 
has leveraged the completion of 2,310 housing units to date, of which 80% are affordable. 
0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS 
Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative 
energy production, CPCFA is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's 
environmental goals. CPCFA is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources ("Independent Contributors") 
including federal and state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority. 
Using the Independent Contributor program and the CalCAP loan loss reserve model, the CPCFA partnered with the California 
Air Resources Board (CARB) to assist truck and bus owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of 
$215.9 million in Air Quality Improvement Program funds to incentivize lending for cleaner vehicles that comply with CARB's 
Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The CalCAP-CARB Heavy-Duty Vehicle Air Quality Loan Program ended on July 31, 2023. 
CPCFA continues to partner with CARB to implement a zero-emissions loan loss reserve program. CPCFA has received 
funding from three separate entities and has implemented programs focusing on Zero-Emissions equipment and infrastructure. 
All three of CalCAP’s Zero-Emission Heavy Duty (ZEHD) programs incentivize lenders by incentivizing lenders through 
CalCAP’s Loan Loss Reserve model. Over $9 million has been received from CARB to implement the Zero-Emission Heavy 
Duty Vehicle (ZEHDV) Loan program. The ZEHDV program provides credit enhancement for small fleets purchasing zero-
emission heavy duty on-road vehicles in California. $5 million has been received from the California Energy Commission (CEC) 
to implement the Zero-Emission Heavy Duty Infrastructure (ZEHDI) Loan program. The ZEHDI program provides credit 
enhancement for businesses acquiring charging stations and/or hydrogen refueling stations. $20.5 million has been received 
from Southern California Edison (SCE) to implement the Zero-Emission Truck, Bus, & Infrastructure Financing (ZETBIF) 
Program. The ZETBIF program provides credit enhancement for businesses located in SCE’s service area for the purchase of 
heavy- duty battery-electric on- and off-road vehicles, as well as the associated charging infrastructure. 
CPCFA previously partnered with the CEC to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit enhancements and rebates 
to small business borrowers and multi-unit dwellings to install electric vehicle charging stations. The CalCAP Electric Vehicle 
Charging Station (EVCS) Financing Program ended on March 31, 2022. 
0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES 
The objective of the California Capital Access program for Americans with Disabilities (CalCAP/ADA) created by Chapter 787, 
Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and increase 
access for employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other financial institutions to make loans to very small 
businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided CPCFA an appropriation of $10 million effective January 
1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the CalCAP model incentivizing lenders to enroll qualifying 
loans. The program also offers borrowers a rebate toward the cost of the Certified Access Specialist (CAS) Report. 
0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM 
The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time 
allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to administer a credit enhancement program for qualified small businesses 
and residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of

Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other 
financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the 
program. 
0878 - CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION PROGRAM 
The California Investment and Innovation Program (Cal IIP) is authorized by Chapter 68, Statutes of 2022, (SB 193) and was 
provided a one-time allocation of $50 million from the General Fund into a new special fund, the California Investment and 
Innovation Fund. Cal IIP provides grants to federally certified Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to 
enhance their capacity in offering services such as technical assistance and capital access to economically disadvantaged 
communities across California. The grants help CDFIs strengthen their operations and attract additional funding, further 
supporting community development. The Cal IIP program is tasked with awarding up to $15 million annually. Awards shall be 
announced by February 1 of each year, starting with February 1, 2024. In 2024, the Cal IIP program awarded 63 applicants 
with a total of $14,200,000 in grant funds.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM 
In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3 
established the second Children's Hospital Program. In 2018, Proposition 4 established a third Children’s Hospital Program. 
The purpose of the three programs is to improve the health and welfare of California's critically ill children by providing a stable 
and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's hospitals and, under Proposition 4, hospitals that 
provide pediatric services for children eligible for California Children’s Services. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is 
derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition 
3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4. 
0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES BONDS, LOANS, AND GRANTS 
The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health 
institutions.

repayment of the bonds. To qualify for funding, the borrower must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit 
corporation or association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district. An eligible project may include, but not be limited to, 
the construction, expansion, remodeling, renovation, furnishing, or equipping, or funding, financing, or refinancing of a health 
facility. 
Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II 
The Authority administers the Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II (HELP II) to assist small and rural health facilities in 
obtaining financing for their capital needs. HELP II provides three percent and four percent fixed interest rate loans of up to $2 
million to California's nonprofit small and rural health facilities in an efficient, timely, and cost-effective manner. HELP II loans 
may be used to purchase or construct new facilities, remodel or renovate existing facilities, purchase equipment and/or 
furnishings, and refinance existing debt. 
Distressed Hospital Loan Program 
Chapter 6, Statutes of 2023 (AB 112) and Chapter 42, Statutes of 2023 (AB 118) establish the Distressed Hospital Loan 
Program administered by the Department of Health Care Access and Information, in collaboration with the Authority, to provide 
up to $300 million in interest-free, cashflow loans to not-for-profit hospitals and public hospitals in significant financial distress, 
or to governmental entitites representing a closed hospital to prevent the closure of, or facilitate the reopening of, those closed 
hospitals. 
Nondesignated Public Hospital Bridge Loan Program 
The Nondesignated Public Hospital Bridge Loan Program provides intrest-free cashflow loans to eligible nondesignated public 
hospitals affected by the financial delays associated with the transition from the Public Hospital Redesign and Incentives in 
Medi-Cal PRIME Program to the Quality Incentive Program. These loans are required to be paid back within two years and are 
secured by the borrower’s Medi-Cal reimbursements. The 2021 Budget Act included $40 million one-time General Fund 
moneys and the 2022 Budget Act included $40 million one-time General Fund moneys to support this program. 
Specialty Dental Clinic Grant Program 
The Budget Acts of 2022 (Section 47, chapter 45, Statutes of 2022) and 2023 (Section 2.00, Chapter 12, Statutes of 2023) 
allocated a combined total of $50 million dollars for the Specialty Dental Clinic Grant Program to provide grants to eligible 
entities to support the construction, expansion, modification, or adaptation of specialty dental clinics to increase access to oral 
health care for the special health care needs populations. The program funds facility acquisition, construction/ renovation, and 
furnishing and equipment costs for dental providers and dental colleges. 
0890 - MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANTS 
• Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 Grant Program 
Chapter 34, Statutes of 2013 (SB 82), the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 established a grant program to

health crisis support programs. Specifically, funds may be used to increase capacity for client assistance and services in crisis 
intervention, crisis stabilization, crisis residential treatment, rehabilitative mental health services, and mobile crisis support 
teams. The grants will support capital improvement, expansion and limited start-up costs. 
 
• Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for Children and Youth 
Chapter 30, Statutes of 2016 (SB 833), Section 20 established the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for 
Children and Youth to increase mental health services for children and youth 21 years of age and under to develop a complete 
continuum of crisis services. Working with counties, the program funds facility acquisition, construction/renovation, equipment 
acquisition, applicable startup or expansion costs to develop crisis residential treatment and crisis stabilization facilities, mobile 
crisis support teams, and family respite care facilities. Counties are also eligible to receive limited personnel funding for up to 
five years to support mobile crisis support teams. 
 
• Community Services Infrastructure Grant Program 
Chapter 33, Statutes of 2016 (SB 843), Section 52 established the Community Services Infrastructure Grant Program to 
expand community alternatives to jail and prison. The program seeks to expand access to jail and prison diversion programs 
and services for those with mental health illness, substance use disorders, or who have suffered from trauma. Working with 
counties, the program funds facility acquisition, renovation, equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs for 
facilities that provide services to this population. 
• No Place Like Home Program 
Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home (NPLH) Program, which requires the Department

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD 
CalABLE provides persons with disabilities an opportunity to save and invest without jeopardizing access to public benefits. To 
be eligible, persons must have a disability that is recognized by the Social Security Administration, and the disability must have 
started before the age of 26. CalABLE account holders can make or receive contributions of up to $19,000 during a taxable 
year. Funds may accumulate and grow in CalABLE investments with no federal or state income taxes or penalties if the 
contributions are used to pay for qualified expenses. 
Hundreds of thousands of Californians with disabilities rely on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, but federal law 
generally restricts them from having more than $2,000 in accumulated assets. However, CalABLE is not subject to this asset 
limit, allowing account holders to save up to $100,000 while maintaining SSI eligibility. This makes CalABLE a critical tool for 
persons with disabilities to live independently, save income, and plan for major expenses. 
In 2022, Governor Newsom signed AB 2216 into law, limiting state protections from Medi-Cal recovery upon the death of an 
ABLE beneficiary, only to CalABLE account holders, and permitting CalABLE account holders who are working to contribute up 
to the full amount allowable under the federal ABLE to Work provision. In 2023, the Governor signed AB 339 into law, 
expanding eligibility to open a CalABLE account to individuals whose disability began before age 46. This law conforms with a 
change in federal law and will go into effect in 2026.

0984   CalSavers Retirement Savings Board 
The CalSavers Retirement Savings Board (Board) was established by Chapter 734, Statutes of 2012 (SB 1234). Chapter 804, 
Statutes of 2016 (SB 1234), subsequently authorized the Board to implement the CalSavers Retirement Savings Program 
(CalSavers), a state-administered retirement savings program for private sector employees in California with no access to 
workplace retirement savings plans. The Board’s mission is to ensure all Californians have a path to financial security in 
retirement by providing a simple, portable, low-cost way for workers to invest in their futures. 
The Board consists of nine members: the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the Director of the Department of Finance, the State 
Controller, a retirement savings and investment expert appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, an employee 
representative appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly, a small business representative appointed by the Governor, a public 
member appointed by the Governor, and two additional members appointed by the Governor.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0910 - CALSAVERS 
The Program provides workers access to a simple, portable, low-cost retirement savings account. Any private sector employer 
with at least one employee that does not offer a workplace retirement savings vehicle by the statutory compliance deadline, or 
is otherwise exempted, is required to provide their employees with access to the Program. The final compliance deadline for 
employers with five or more employees was June 30, 2022. Following the passage of SB 1126 in 2022, the compliance 
deadline for employers with less than five employees is December 31, 2025.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM 
Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance 
of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are available for loans to schools and 
community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities, 
reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB 
2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs. 
0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM 
Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program 
(CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the 
Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University 
Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, 2016, and 2024 for a total of $2 billion. The program provides a 50 
percent state subsidy for charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the state) 
by the charter school through a 30-year loan. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be financially 
sound, and meet other program eligibility requirements.  
0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM 
In 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2024, CSFA received grants under the United States Department of Education’s State Charter School 
Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs. 
Grant funds reimburse a charter school’s costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities 
or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on 
preference points assigned based on the percentage of low-income students, percentage of overcrowding, not-for-profit status, 
and demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. 
0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM 
The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and 
lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged 
students. Eligible charter schools are provided the lesser of $1,432 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, or 75 percent 
of annual facilities rent and lease costs.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND 
Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of 
up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is 
available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference goes to schools that have 
not opened nor completed their full charter term. 
0938 - STUDENT HOUSING REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM 
Chapter 572, Statutes of 2022 established the California Student Housing Revolving Loan Fund, which provides zero-interest 
loans for affordable student, faculty, and staff housing.

LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
0940 - BOND FINANCING 
CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational 
facilities. Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms 
than might otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the 
construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or 
the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating 
institution is pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private activity" 
bond ceiling as specified in federal law. 
For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "participating private college" means a nonprofit, 
private, regionally accredited, degree-granting college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's 
race or ethnicity and provided that the financing does not violate constitutional provisions. 
"Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to 
issue tax-exempt public offering or private placement loans for participating institutions, which may provide greater cost savings 
than these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing. 
0951 - STUDENT HOUSING REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM 
Chapter 572, Statutes of 2022, established the California Student Housing Revolving Loan Fund (CaSH RLF), which provides 
zero-interest loans for affordable student housing and affordable faculty and staff housing. The Budget Act of 2024 included the 
reversion of funding for the CaSHRLF.? 
0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND 
Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund (Fund) and allocate and 
certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes 
of 2015, added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018. Chapter 527, Statutes of 2017, extended CEFA's responsibility to administer the 
tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2023.?Chapter 976, Statues of 2022, 
extended CEFA’s responsibility further to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2028.?Chapter 278, Statutes of 2023, 
altered the target student population that the Fund could benefit from students that receive Cal Grant B awards to qualifying 
community college student transfers to regionally accredited Historically Black Colleges and Universities that have an associate 
degree for transfer memorandum of understanding on file with the office of the Chancellor of the California Community 
Colleges.
