3125   California Tahoe Conservancy 
The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational 
resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs 
that acquire environmentally sensitive land; restoring the thousands of parcels it owns to improve stream environments, wildlife 
habitats, forest health, and water quality; and providing grants to fund soil erosion prevention, watershed restoration, improve 
forest health, and reduce wildfire risk on other public lands. The Conservancy balances these activities with programs to 
improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by acquiring lakefront property, 
constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 
The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to 
restore and protect the Basin's natural resources. The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the 
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed 
to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 
Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program 
to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 
The Conservancy manages nearly 4,700 state-owned properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of 
quarter-acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, 
and have significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple 
benefits and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and 
encroachments. Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental 
role of the Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational 
amenities, including 6 beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe. 
The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to 
more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a 
wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also 
increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire, 
clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This 
work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change. 
The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site 
improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating 
public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake. 
2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 
This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing 
facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide 
variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds 
such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality. 
In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting 
urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive 
Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town 
center objectives.  Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other 
environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California Tahoe Conservancy manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife habitat, 
watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary implementer 
of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake Tahoe Basin - a 
1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local 
governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.
