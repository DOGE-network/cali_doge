MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Proposition 57 Implementation- Overall, the Budget includes net savings of $38.8 million. The savings reflect the
anticipated increase in the number of juvenile court commitments to the Division of Juvenile Justice, and the proposed
parole and credit earning changes that result in reductions to the adult inmate population and increases to the adult
parole population. The Budget includes $6.7 million General Fund to implement an expanded parole review process for
inmates convicted of a non-violent offense after they have served the full term of their primary offense, and to
implement changes to offender credit earning for good behavior and rehabilitative achievements. The requested
resources will fund additional case records staff to review and make various changes to inmate classification files
related to the new credit earning structure and parole process, parole workload due to additional releases from prison,
and Board of Parole Hearings workload for the increased number of inmates considered for release.
 
Video Surveillance Pilot Program-The Budget includes $11.7 million General Fund to implement a video surveillance
pilot program at High Desert State Prison and Central California Women's Facility, aimed at improving the prison
environment.
 
Drug and Contraband Interdiction-The Budget includes $6.7 million General Fund to add 42 canine teams to the
existing 28.  These resources will enable the Department to establish two permanent canine teams at each institution
as a statewide drug and contraband interdiction strategy.
 
Roof Replacements-The Budget includes an increase of $34.9 million General Fund for roof replacements at the
California Correctional Institution, Pleasant Valley State Prison, and Salinas Valley State Prison.
 
Transfer of Intermediate and Acute Levels of Care-The Budget redirects $254.4 million General Fund and 1,977.6
positions from the Department of State Hospitals to reflect the transfer of the psychiatric programs from State Hospitals
to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to streamline operations.  This transfer is effective July 1,
2017.
 
Receiver: California Prison Industry Authority Janitorial Services Expansion-The Budget includes $6 million General
Fund in 2016-17 and $13.8 million General Fund beginning in 2017-18 to expand California Prison Industry Authority
janitorial services to space constructed through the Health Care Facility Improvement Program and Statewide
Medication Distribution improvements.

Receiver: Health Care Appeals-The Budget includes $5.4 million General Fund to establish a new health care appeals
process based on a pilot program that was launched by the Receiver in September 2015. This process involves a
clinical review to better respond to medical issues when inmates file an appeal.
 
Receiver: Medication Management Staffing-The Budget includes $6.7 million General Fund to augment medication
management staffing at various institutions.
 
Receiver: Health Care Assets Property Controllers-The Budget includes $2.1 million General Fund to provide dedicated
property controllers to track and service health care assets. These positions will track and schedule required
maintenance to ensure timely completion, monitor expiration dates on materials for reordering or redistribution, and
track all equipment to eliminate misplaced assets.
 
Receiver: Suicide Watch Coverage-The Budget includes $3.1 million General Fund for additional nursing staff to
provide suicide watch coverage. The requested resources will provide additional staff at institutions with an Enhanced
Outpatient Program or a Reception Center since these institutions have a higher rate of inmates on suicide watch, and
temporary help resources at the remaining institutions.
 
Receiver: Physician Retention Strategies-The Budget includes $7 million General Fund to implement telemedicine and
regional support team physician retention strategies to address issues with retention for physician positions.

5227    Board of State and Community Corrections
 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and
technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal
justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 public safety
realignment.  This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices, including prevention,
intervention, suppression, and supervision.  The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is
consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-
based strategies for managing criminal justice populations. 
 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has
a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure
Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
State Penalty Fund Redistribution-Due to the continuing decline of revenues to the State Penalty Fund, the Budget
includes various solutions to address the insolvency of the Fund, including direct appropriations from the Fund for
certain departments. Specifically, the Budget includes a direct appropriation of $17.2 million from the State Penalty
Fund for the Standards and Training for Local Corrections program to maintain critical local law enforcement training
services. The Budget also eliminates $9.5 million Restitution Fund for the California Gang Reduction and Intervention
Program but includes a one-time $9.5 million General Fund augmentation to continue a modified and renamed
California Violence Intervention and Prevention program.

The objective of the Corrections Planning and Grant Program is to provide leadership in the development, administration,
and evaluation of grant programs and plans to improve the effectiveness of state and local correctional systems.
Specifically, the program provides technical assistance and training in planning and program implementation. In addition, the
program is responsible for reviewing plans for implementing 2011 public safety realignment submitted by counties and
providing technical assistance and coordination to local governments. 
 
4950 - LOCAL FACILITY STANDARDS, OPERATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION 
 
The objective of the Local Facility Standards, Operations and Construction Program is to work in collaboration with local
corrections agencies to maintain and enhance the safety, security, and efficiency of state and local jails and juvenile
detention facilities. This program also works in collaboration with state and local government agencies in administering
funding for local detention facility construction projects. 
 
4955 - STANDARDS AND TRAINING FOR LOCAL CORRECTIONS 
 
The objective of the Standards and Training for Local Corrections Program is to work directly with local corrections officials
to establish minimum standards for personnel selection and training. This program also provides technical assistance to
agencies to improve local training outcomes, administers a statewide training course certification process designed to
ensure the competence of local corrections professionals, and provides funding to local agencies to offset a portion of the
costs associated with meeting these training standards.

DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS 
 
 
5420    Prison Industry Authority
 
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional
industries in a manner similar to private industry.  The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much
like a corporate board of directors.  The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General
Services or his or her designee, the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public
members appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,
and four members appointed by the Governor representing organized labor and industry.  The Secretary of the CDCR or his
or her designee serves as chair of the Board. 
 
The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good
work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison.  The CALPIA
work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming. 
 
The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that
provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within
enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work
productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work
programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and
services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the
costs of its operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
