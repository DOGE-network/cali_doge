INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California High-Speed Rail Authority is currently headquartered in Sacramento, with regional offices in San Jose, Fresno 
and Los Angeles. Planning is currently underway for the entire high-speed train system, which consists of Phase 1 (San 
Francisco to Los Angeles/Anaheim) and Phase 2 (extensions to Sacramento and San Diego). The Authority has entered into 
design-build contracts and continues to acquire real property and right-of-way accesses for the first construction section of the 
high-speed rail system, extending 119 miles from Madera to just north of Bakersfield.

2670   Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and 
Suisun 
The Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun is the oversight body that licenses 
and regulates the maritime pilots who navigate certain large vessels entering or leaving those bays, Monterey Bay, and on 
tributaries to Sacramento and Stockton. 
The Board's responsibilities include training and licensing maritime pilots, establishing standards for pilot fitness, incident 
investigation, approval of pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, oversight of the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan, and 
providing pilotage fee rate recommendations to the Legislature. The seven members of the Board are appointed by the 
Governor with the consent of the Senate, and the Secretary of the Transportation Agency is an ex-officio member. The Board 
was established in California's first Legislative Session, and has been in continuous existence since 1850. 
All of the operational and program expenses of the Board are funded by various surcharges set by the Board, and are paid by 
the shipping companies that utilize services of Board-licensed maritime pilots. The Board Operations Surcharge funds the cost 
of Board operations, and is set as a percentage of pilotage fees. Three separate surcharges are based upon ship movements 
and fund a continuing education program for pilots, a pilot trainee training program, and the acquisition of navigation technology 
for use by pilots. Two separate surcharges are based on the tonnage of the vessel that arrives or leaves the San Francisco Bay 
and fund pilot boat acquisitions and improvements, and the San Francisco Bar Pilot Pension Plan.

2720   Department of the California Highway Patrol 
The California Highway Patrol (CHP) promotes the safe, convenient, and efficient transportation of people and goods across 
the state highway system and provides the highest level of safety and security to the facilities and employees of the State of 
California.

need. For the specifics on the CHP's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

2740   Department of Motor Vehicles 
The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) promotes driver safety by licensing drivers and protects consumers by issuing 
vehicle titles and regulating vehicle sales. 
Because DMV's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, DMV has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on DMV's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• DMV Operational Improvements — The Budget includes $226 million from multiple fund sources, including $207.7 million 
one-time and up to 1,873.3 temporary positions and $34 million ongoing and 178.8 positions to address both immediate and 
long-term needs within DMV.  Funding will allow DMV to address the anticipated demand for 9.8 million federally compliant 
REAL Driver Licenses and Identification Cards, allow field offices to accept credit cards, upgrade IT equipment and 
functionality, and improve its operational and managerial processes.  The program change consists of an increase of $242 
million Motor Vehicle Account and a reduction of $9.8 million in other special funds for a net increase of $234 million.  The 
Budget also removes $8.5 million of the SB 1 Transportation Funding Governor's Budget proposal for a total program 
change of $226 million.  These reductions reflect the fiscal impact of passing credit card convenience fees on to DMV 
customers.
