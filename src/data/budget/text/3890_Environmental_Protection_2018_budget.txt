Environmental
Protection
California Environmental Protection Agency
programs reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
restore and protect environmental quality, and
protect public health. The Secretary coordinates
the state's environmental regulatory programs and
ensures fair and consistent enforcement of
environmental law, which safeguards the state's
residents and promotes the state's economic
vitality.

Air Resources Board
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air
pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for
Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40
percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB
32).
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
The Air Resources Board has 56 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 55 sites are occupied through
lease, permit, or license agreements. Of the non state-owned sites, 34 support air-monitoring stations and 21 sites support an
array of vehicle testing, research, planning, enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs;
some of the support sites are also equipped with an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air
Resources Board oversees to support its statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's
exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air
Resources Board leadership role related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND BROWNFIELDS REUSE
The Site Mitigation and Brownfields Reuse program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal
Superfund program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,170 hazardous substance release site investigations and
cleanups, and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 470 sites where the cleanup process is
complete. Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 820 land-use
restrictions in place on properties throughout the state.
New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other
previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to
return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties,
abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military
installations.
The program oversees environmental assessments and the clean-up of proposed new or expanding school sites to prevent or
reduce exposing students and staff to hazardous substances. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous
Waste Site, a former hazardous waste disposal site and federal Superfund Site.
The program works closely with other state agencies, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and local agencies
throughout the state to establish and implement viable grant and loan programs to aid in the assessment and clean-up of
brownfields sites.
The program works with the California Emergency Management Agency and other state agencies to assure response
readiness for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous
waste spills and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories.
3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of
hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at
119 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 900 registered businesses that transport hazardous
waste, and approximately 300 facilities/generators that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages
approximately $2.2 billion in financial assurance resources, and supports and oversees local agencies implementing the
hazardous waste elements of the Unified Program.
The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including
electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste
requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused
enforcement initiatives. The program also ensures compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste
and used oil.
3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS
The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program strives to get manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to
toxic chemicals. SCP calls for industry to develop safer consumer products and use pollution prevention best practices. The
program implements the SCP regulations. SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order
to identify Priority Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the
analysis of safer alternatives; and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption
of "green chemistry" practices.
Pollution Prevention responsibilities are to promote compliance with legislative mandates regarding consumer product chemical
safety. The program supports adoption of focused business sector pollution prevention strategies; supports local green
business initiatives; and helps the regulated community comply with laws and regulations.
This program, in conjunction with the Department of Public Health and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment,
also implements the California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program. The Department's Environmental
Chemistry Laboratory (ECL) is charged with measuring both targeted and new chemicals in blood and urine. Ongoing activities
include measuring these chemicals in studies of vulnerable populations, including mothers and their newborns, older women,
firefighters, and families with childhood leukemia. Additionally, ECL is continuously developing new methods to identify and
measure chemicals of emerging concern, including newer flame retardants and other substitutes and alternatives for restricted/
banned toxic chemicals. The SCP program will rely on biomonitoring results for implementation of its three-year Priority

Products Work Plan. Biomonitoring evidence has been identified in the Work Plan as a priority screening tool for identification
of product-chemical combinations warranting consideration of safer alternatives.
3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY
The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)
in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the Department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified
Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for
owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response
plans and inventories; California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements
pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories.
3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEAN UP PROGRAM
The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Clean Up Program oversees the removal and remedial actions in the
communities surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as the facility itself. Under the program,
the Department will test the soil for lead contamination in approximately 10,000 properties, including residences, schools,
daycare centers, and parks within a 1.7 mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated soil at those
properties with the highest levels and greatest potential for exposure.
9900 - ADMINISTRATION
The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce management,
information management, and business services. The program also provides legal counsel, external communication, analytical
chemistry support, environmental justice and tribal affairs consultation, and public participation services.

Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances public health and the environment through
objective scientific evaluation of risks posed by hazardous substances. The Office performs risk assessments for various
regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other state and local agencies, and
provides these programs with the scientific tools and information upon which to base risk management decisions. Distinct
programs focus on assessing health risks, including risks to children and other sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to
chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, hazardous and municipal waste facilities, fish and
shellfish, and sediments in bay and estuarine waters. The Office also evaluates community pollution burdens and
vulnerabilities.
