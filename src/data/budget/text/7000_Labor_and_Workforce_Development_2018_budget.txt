Labor and
Workforce
Development
The Labor and Workforce Development Agency
was established to address issues relating to
California workers and their employers. The
Agency is responsible for labor law enforcement,
workforce development, and benefit payment and
adjudication. The Agency works to combat the
underground economy and help legitimate
businesses and workers in California through a
combination of enforcement and education
activities.

Employment Development Department
The Employment Development Department enhances California's economic growth and prosperity by collaboratively delivering
valuable and innovative services to meet the evolving needs of employers, workers, and job seekers. The Department
connects employers with job seekers, administers the Unemployment Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Paid Family Leave
programs, and provides employment and training programs under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
Additionally, the Department collects various employment payroll taxes including the personal income tax, and collects and
provides comprehensive economic, occupational, and socio-demographic labor market information concerning California's
workforce.
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
5900 - EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT RELATED SERVICES
The objective of the Employment and Employment Related Services Program is to provide a variety of services to facilitate a
match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an Internet labor exchange system to facilitate
this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are designed to
provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans,
youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited
locations designed for executive, technical, and professional job seekers to assist each other in finding suitable employment.

5915 - CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD
The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board is a quasi-judicial agency whose primary purpose is to conduct
impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax
liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one
each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly.
The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition, the
Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit
programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction.
5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM
The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California
workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income
replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own.
5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM
The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing
monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who take
time off from work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent-in-
law or to bond with a new minor child.
5930 - TAX PROGRAM
The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax
collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support
the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs.
5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL
The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including
small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages
and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention
and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes
special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout
the state.
5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT
The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment
Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide
and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of California in local
communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce,
veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to
job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention,
earnings, and occupational skills of participants.
5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS
The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as National Emergency Grant Program,
consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers due
to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to
react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6070 - PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD
The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) itself is composed of five members appointed to five-year terms by the
Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. In addition to the overall responsibility for administering the various public
sector collective bargaining laws, the Board itself acts as an appellate body to hear challenges to proposed decisions and

LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
dismissals of unfair practice charges that are issued by staff. Any appeal related to the representation process is also heard by
the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate courts.
The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to:
•
Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively
represent them in their labor relations with their employer.
•
Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees,
and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws.
•
Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings.
•
Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it
administers.
OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for managing the investigation and resolution of unfair practice charges and
preside over informal settlement conferences. The Representation Section oversees the statutory process through which
employees come to form a bargaining unit and select an organization to represent them in their labor relations with their
employer. Additionally, this section defends PERB decisions in court, seeks appropriate injunctive relief, and obtains
enforcement when a party does not comply with final Board decisions.
DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW
The Division of Administrative Law conducts adjudicative proceedings, which includes the presentation of evidence and
examination of witnesses under oath. Proposed decisions are issued consisting of written findings of fact and legal conclusions.
STATE MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE
The State Mediation and Conciliation Service was established in 1947 to promote harmonious labor/management relations in
California and became a division of PERB on July 1, 2012. The division mediates labor disputes between employers and
employee organizations and conducts consent elections. In addition, the division provides lists of arbitrators, workplace conflict
resolution mediation, and interest-based bargaining training/facilitation services.
DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATION
The Division of Administration supports operations by facilitating and managing the budget, human resources management,
business services, procurement and contracting, fiscal accountability, information technology infrastructure, and other
administrative needs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS
This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group of
employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is
actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program requires that each self-insured private-
sector employer posts a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer
defaults on its obligations.
6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION
The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize
disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides
administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits.
The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system
required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured
Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and

sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system
designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system.
Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical
Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-
based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by
identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system.
The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers'
compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court,
and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.
6095 - COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION
The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for: (1) issuing an annual report on the state
of the workers' compensation system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications which would
improve the operation of the system; (2) conducting specified surveys and evaluations required by law; (3) conducting
continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and
occupational diseases, including making recommendations on how to improve the workers' compensation and health and
safety program, and if it deems appropriate, conducting or contracting for studies necessary to carry out its responsibilities; (4)
maintaining the occupational safety and health training and education program and funding an insurance loss control services
coordinator; and (5) issuing, if necessary, a report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of the notices
required to be provided by insurers and self-insured employers.
6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH
The objectives of this program include the promotion and enforcement of measures to protect the health and safety of workers
on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels for the
benefit of the general public. These objectives are accomplished by the coordinated efforts of the Division of Occupational
Safety and Health (DOSH), the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational
Safety and Health Appeals Board (Cal/OSHA Appeals Board).
DOSH enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries, and
helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. DOSH conducts inspections of, and issues permits to
operate, elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, and pressure vessels. The
inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these
devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, DOSH also obtains and maintains job safety records,
reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and provides
accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by state and
local government.
The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as
follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor,
one member from the field of occupational health, and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in
the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards
enforced by DOSH.
The Cal/OSHA Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations
and accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by DOSH for violations of occupational safety and health standards. It is
comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, one member from
the field of management, and one member from the field of labor.
6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT
The objectives of this program include: (1) interpretation and enforcement of sections of the Labor Code which relate to wages,
hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees engaged in protected
activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders (as applicable); (2) determination and collection
of unpaid wages; 3) the licensing of farm labor contractors, industrial homework firms, and talent agencies; the certification of
studio teachers; the registration of garment manufacturers, car washing and polishing businesses, and entities and individuals
using minors in door-to-door sales; and permitting for both the employment of minors in the entertainment industry and the
individuals representing or providing services to minors in the entertainment industry; (4) field enforcement of laws governing
public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed contractors, rules governing meals and rest periods, the
payment of overtime and minimum wage, the licensing of specific industries, and the payment of wages without required
deductions; (5) under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, vigorous and targeted enforcement in partnership with
state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the "underground economy" and administration of
the prevailing wage program, to determine and publish prevailing wage rates for public works projects; (6) enforcement of
apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works projects; and (7) management of the Electrician Certification
Program that tests for the minimum standards for competency and training for electricians in California.

6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS
The objectives of this program are to promote, develop, and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs and to
provide consultation services to program sponsors. The Division's goal is to match the needs of workers with those of
employers, and to strengthen the apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting
workers and teaching the skills they and their employers need.
The Division administers the apprenticeship system in California. This includes initial program approval and subsequent
oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs
and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws.
The California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the
general policy under which this program operates.
6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES
The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers'
compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required
under the Labor Code.
The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor
Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be
disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
