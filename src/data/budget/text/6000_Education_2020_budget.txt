Education 
Education programs provide academic services 
segmented by pre-kindergarten, elementary, 
secondary, undergraduate and graduate programs 
as well as credentialing services to ensure 
schools are staffed with effective instructors. 
Elementary and secondary instruction is provided 
to all of California's children to prepare them for 
higher education or entry into the workforce. 
Institutions of higher education provide further 
access to the skills necessary for career goals and 
participation in a globally competitive workforce, 
as well as conducting research and providing 
public services. 
6100   Department of Education 
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million 
students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Equity and Access Branch; the 
Operations and Administration Branch; the Opportunities for All Branch; the Instruction and Measurement Branch; and the 
Legal and Audits Branch. 
 
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to 
work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding 
local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to 
enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and 
supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that 
promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the 
administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing 
broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering 
systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help 
students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that 
promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the Department. 
Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

Provides a full range of child care and development services, including part- and full-time child care and development and 
supportive services to children from low-income families and families with special needs. Several different programs exist to 
target resources to specific populations or to address specific needs. The California State Preschool Program provides a wide 
range of educational services in part-day settings for pre-kindergarten (three and four-year-old) children from low-income 
families and parent education for the parents of eligible children. The After School Education and Safety program provides 
students in grades K-9 with academic support, homework assistance, and enrichment programs, in a safe after-school 
environment. Child care services for families participating in the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids

Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership: 
Provides federal funding for high quality infant and toddler child care to low income families enrolled in subsidized programs 
administered by county offices, family child care home education networks, center-based homes, and tribal governments 
receiving federal Child Care and Development funds in selected northern California counties. 
Child Nutrition: 
Provides oversight, support, educational training, technical assistance, funding and grant opportunities to participating public 
and private schools, county offices of education, public and private residential child care institutions, camps, family day care 
homes, and non-residential adult day care centers to increase access and serve nutritious meals that meet specific federal 
standards. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) funds the reimbursement for local child nutrition program 
sponsors that serve nutritious meals to children and adults participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School 
Breakfast Program, Special Milk Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program, After School 
Meals Supplements Program under the NSLP, and Seamless Summer Feeding Option. Collectively the child nutrition programs

6125   Education Audit Appeals Panel 
The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals by 
K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of 
substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory 
timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits, including Local School Construction Bond Audits and School Facility 
Program Bond Fund Audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear standards for compliance with education funding requirements, and 
allow both the state and local educational agencies to avoid lengthy and expensive litigation over disputed funding.

6300   State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System 
The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). 
The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members' 
creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an 
additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on 
July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469), increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three 
years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers’ Retirement Board can increase 
the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 
The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in 
quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing 
power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389), increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection 
payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers’ Retirement Board is required to 
set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to 
CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an 
amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding 
calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15 
of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers’ 
Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) 
increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 
DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY 
Education Code, Title 1, Division 1, Part 13, Chapter 16. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes $3.4 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. The Budget also suspends the authority 
of the Teachers’ Retirement Board to increase the state’s contribution in fiscal year 2020-21 pursuant to Education Code 
section 22955.1. Program 5350 includes $169 million, which is the value of the increase in state contribution in fiscal year 
2020-21 had the Teachers Retirement Board had the authority to increase the state rate.  The related savings, as a result of 
the rate suspension, is accounted for separately and not included in this display. The Budget instead provides CalSTRS a 
$297 million supplemental pension payment using Proposition 2 debt repayment funding, as displayed in Program 9990 and 
as described below. 
• In addition to the state’s statutorily-required annual contribution, the Budget includes a $297 million supplemental pension 
payment to CalSTRS in 2020-21. Education Code section 22955.2 authorizes the state to make supplemental pension 
payments to CalSTRS towards the state's share of the unfunded liability for the Defined Benefit Program. Approximately 
$2.9 billion is scheduled to be paid over fiscal years 2019-20 through 2023-24 using available Proposition 2 debt payment 
funding.

6350   School Facilities Aid Program 
The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities 
such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.  This program is administered by the State Allocation 
Board, which is staffed by the Office of Public School Construction within the Department of General Services. 
The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility 
Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Since 1998, California voters have approved over $42 billion in 
statewide general obligation bonds to construct or renovate public school classrooms through the SFP.  These funds primarily 
support the construction and modernization of school facilities, however, voters have supported funding other programs through 
the SFP including, but not limited to: (1) charter school facility grants, (2) career technical education grants, (3) overcrowding 
relief projects, (4) high performance incentive grants, (5) joint-use projects, (6) critically overcrowded schools grants, and (7) 
seismic mitigation grants. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, authorized a total of $7 billion in state general 
obligation bonds for school construction projects. These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 
billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical 
education projects. 
The 2018 Budget Act provided one-time General Fund to support the Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program to help 
school districts address the facility costs associated with providing full-day kindergarten programs.  The Full-Day Kindergarten 
Facilities Grant Program is also administered by the State Allocation Board.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure 
a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 281,000 applications annually for 
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the 
primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential 
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 
The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas, 
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including 
the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and 
development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the 
Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to 
monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of 
program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program 
approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated 
assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal 
advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of 
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and 
applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct 
disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions. 
5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES 
This program provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission in credential holder discipline 
cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process. 
5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT 
The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher 
preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface. 
5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS 
This program supports development and implementation of Performance Assessments for credential candidates in preparation 
programs that lead to a teaching or administative services credential.  In addition to ensuring that credential candidates are 
prepared to enter the teaching profession or serve as a school administrator, candidate scores from these assessments will be 
included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment.

6440   University of California 
The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic 
programs through the doctoral degree level; research; education for professional careers; and public service. 
UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 1879 as 
a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the following 26 
members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms, 
and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents. 
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. In 
addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment primarily 
responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 
There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa 
Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education. 
The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and 
administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States 
Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories. 
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource 
allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated 
authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

◦ $345,000 for a baseline immigrant legal services adjustment. 
• Contingent General Fund Reductions—Absent additional federal funds pursuant to Control Section 8.28, a decrease of

activities of students and faculty are included. 
Health Sciences 
This program includes instruction in 19 schools that provide education in various health fields to students preparing for careers 
in health care, teaching, and research. The health science schools are located on seven campuses and include six schools of 
medicine (Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego and San Francisco), two schools of dentistry, four schools of 
nursing, three schools of public health, two schools of pharmacy, one school of veterinary medicine, and one school of 
optometry. In addition, programs in medical education are conducted at Berkeley, Fresno, and the Charles R. Drew University

education, and similar activities throughout the state and in several foreign countries. University Extension has open enrollment 
courses for individuals as well as organizational partnerships supported by contracts and grants with the state and public 
agencies, non-profit organizations, and private companies. University Extension's offerings are often designed to serve the 
continuing educational needs of working professionals. University Extension offers certificate programs and undergraduate and 
graduate transferable degree credit. 
RESEARCH

primary state-supported academic agency for research. 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
This program includes a broad range of activities organized by the university to serve students, teachers, and staff in K-12 
schools and community colleges, as well as the public in general. The program includes student academic preparation 
programs and educational partnerships. In these programs, the university works with schools and other partners to help certain 
groups of students meet the standards of academic preparation needed to be successful in higher education and the 
workforce. The program also includes UC Cooperative Extension, which provides applied research and educational programs 
in agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer sciences, and community resource development. Campuses also

professional development in the field of education. 
TEACHING HOSPITALS 
This program includes the operation of five academic medical centers in Irvine, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, and San 
Francisco. A critical mission of the medical center hospitals is to support the clinical teaching programs of the University's 
health professional schools. The medical centers provide inpatient and outpatient health care services and are research sites 
for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
This program includes activities that contribute to students' emotional and physical well-being, including their intellectual, 
cultural and social development outside the context of the formal instructional program. Elements of these programs are 
supplementary educational services, social and cultural activities, counseling and career guidance, student health services, 
student admissions and records, and financial aid administration. 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
This program includes police, accounting, payroll, human resources, administrative computing, materials management, 
environmental health and safety, and publications. The program also includes the planning, policymaking, and coordination 
activities that occur within the offices of the chancellors, the university president, and the Regents.

campus provisions and (2) from campus provisions to operating programs and subprograms from which expenditures will 
occur. The program may include funds for academic position upgrades, staff reclassifications, price adjustments, employee 
benefit adjustments, debt service, and university endowment income. 
EXTRAMURAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes activities supported by fund sources defined as non-budgeted due to the limited life of the funding 
source.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5530 - This program provides support for Hastings. Expenditures are for the following purposes: 
INSTRUCTION 
Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal 
profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 
The principal objectives are to: (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal 
profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students 
with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments of legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of professionalism 
for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in 
overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 
The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference 
and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom 
presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The law 
library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
Student services include admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support 
Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices provide 
students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist 
students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment 
opportunities. These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support 
Program (which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other 
services to supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety, 
community relations, and administrative services. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and 
administration of maintenance and renovation activities for the college's plant. 
EXTRAMURAL 
Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. These 
include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate 
instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal arts education programs. For undergraduate programs, each 
campus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to master's-
level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctoral-level programs in education, nursing practice, physical therapy, and 
audiology. The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 
The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16 
members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, 3 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2 student 
representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, and 1 faculty representative), and 1 alumni representative appointed to a two-year 
term by the CSU Alumni Council. The Trustees appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the 
Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty 
representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 
The CSU’s goals include to: 
• Advance and extend knowledge, learning, and culture, especially throughout California. 
• Prepare significant numbers of educated, responsible people to contribute to California’s schools, economy, culture, and 
future. 
• Offer undergraduate and graduate instruction leading to bachelor’s and higher degrees in the liberal arts and sciences, 
applied fields, and the professions, including the doctoral degree when authorized. 
• Prepare students for international, multi-cultural society. 
• Provide public services that enrich the university and its communities.

tutorial instruction; and regular, special, and extension sessions. 
RESEARCH 
The research category includes all expenses for activities specifically organized to produce research, whether commissioned

advisory services, reference bureaus, radio and television, consulting, and similar non-instructional services to particular 
sectors of the community. 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT 
The academic support category includes expenses to provide support services to the institution’s primary missions: instruction, 
research, and public service. This category includes the retention, preservation, and display of educational materials, including 
libraries, museums, and galleries; the provision of services that directly assist the academic functions of the institution, such as 
demonstration schools associated with a department, school, or college of education; media such as audio-visual services and 
technology such as computing support; academic administration and personnel development providing administration support 
and management direction to the three primary missions; and separately budgeted support for course and curriculum 
development. 
STUDENT SERVICES 
The student services category includes expenses incurred for offices of admissions and the registrar and activities with the 
primary purpose of contributing to students' emotional and physical well-being and intellectual, cultural, and social development 
outside the context of the formal instruction program. This category includes expenses for student activities, cultural events, 
student newspapers, intramural athletics, student organizations, intercollegiate athletics, counseling and career guidance, 
student aid administration, and enrollment management and student health service offices. 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
The institutional support category includes expenses for central executive-level activities concerned with management and 
long-range planning for the entire institution, such as the governing board, planning and programming operations, and legal 
services; fiscal operations, including the investment office; administrative data processing; space management; employee 
personnel and records; logistical activities that provide procurement, storerooms, and printing; transportation services to the 
institution; support services to faculty and staff; and activities concerned with community and alumni relations, including 
development and fundraising. 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
The operation and maintenance of plant category includes all expenses for the administration, supervision, operation, 
maintenance, preservation and protection of the institution's physical plant. This category includes expenses normally incurred 
for items such as janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture, and equipment; 
care of grounds; maintenance and operations of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster 
preparedness; safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to property; space and 
capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. 
STUDENT FINANCIAL AID 
Student financial aid includes institutional aid (State University Grants), tuition and fee waivers, scholarships, and fellowships 
from restricted or unrestricted funds. The category also includes trainee stipends, prizes, and awards. 
AUXILIARY ENTERPRISES 
An auxiliary enterprise exists to furnish goods or services to students, faculty, or staff, other institutional departments, or 
incidentally to the general public, and charges a fee directly related to the cost of the goods or services. The distinguishing 
characteristic of an auxiliary enterprise is that it is managed as an essentially self-supporting activity. Examples are residence

6645   CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants 
This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their 
dependents. 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health 
plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 
The 2019-20 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established

in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members 
hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest 
health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also 
contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined 
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2019 monthly contribution 
maximums are $734 for a single enrollee, $1,398 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,788 for an enrollee and two or 
more dependents. The 2020 monthly contribution maximums are $767 for a single enrollee, $1,461 for an enrollee and one 
dependent, and $1,868 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges 
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 
California's 73 community college districts, which operate 115 community colleges. The Board has 17 members appointed by 
the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student 
members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms. 
The objectives of the Board are to: 
• Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 
• Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 
• Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 
related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see 
"Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Cal Grant Program Adjustment—A decrease of approximately $149 million in 2019-20 and approximately $63.3 million in 
2020-21 to reflect revised estimates of the number of new and renewal Cal Grant awardees in 2019-20 and 2020-21. 
• Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Adjustment—A decrease of $600 million in federal TANF reimbursements 
in 2019-20 which increases General Fund support for the Cal Grant program by an equal amount. 
• Golden State Teacher Grant Program—An increase of $15 million one-time federal funds to support grants to students 
enrolled in special education teacher preparation program at a high-need school site. 
• Grant Delivery System—An increase of $5.3 million one-time General Fund to fund the third year and final year of project 
development costs for the Grant Delivery System Modernization Project. 
• Student Loan Debt Service Work Group—An increase of $250,000 one-time General Fund to convene a work group to 
analyze student loan borrowing patterns and develop more affordable loan repayment alternatives. 
• Cal Grant B Service Incentive Grant—A reappropriation of $7.5 million one-time General Fund from the 2019 Budget Act and 
a redirection of the Program's $7.5 million funding in 2020-21 to support the Disaster Relief Emergency Student Financial 
Aid Program, which will provide emergency financial aid to students at the University of California, California State University, 
and California Community Colleges. 
• Child Savings Account Grant Program—A decrease of $15 million one-time General Fund to the Child Savings Account 
program, established in the 2019 Budget Act. 
• Contingent General Fund Reduction—As a result of the COVID-19 Recession and absent the receipt of additional federal 
funds to assist the state with the fiscal crisis, reductions are necessary to balance the state budget. To the extent the federal 
government provides sufficient federal funds by October 15, 2020, which are eligible for purposes identified below, funds will 
be appropriated for the 2020-21 fiscal year as follows: 
◦ A decrease of $88.4 million one-time General Fund for the Golden State Teacher Grant program, established in the 2019

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5755 - FINANCIAL AID GRANTS PROGRAM 
This program provides grants and other kinds of financial aid to help undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at eligible 
institutions pay for educational expenses.  The financial aid programs are described below. 
CAL GRANT PROGRAM 
Cal Grant entitlement awards are guaranteed to students who graduate from high school and meet financial, academic, and 
other general program eligibility requirements.  The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are guaranteed 
to certain community college students who have a community college grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.4 on a four-point 
scale. 
Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility 
requirements.  Half of these awards are offered to those applicants who did not receive an entitlement award and meet a March 
2 deadline.  The remaining awards are offered to students who are enrolled at a California community college and meet a 
September 2 deadline. 
Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 GPA on 
a four-point scale. 
Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point scale. 
The award is for books and living expenses for the first year.  Beginning with the second year, the award also provides funds for 
tuition and fees. 
The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the 
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU).  The annual Budget Act sets the award amount 
for recipients attending private nonprofit or private, for-profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of 
Schools and Colleges (WASC), and the award for recipients attending private, for-profit institutions that are not WASC-
accredited. 
The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training. 
The Cal Grant Students with Dependent Children Access Award Supplement provides or increases access awards for students 
with dependent children attending the UC, CSU, or a California Community College. 
The Cal Grant B Service Incentive Grant Program provides grants to undocumented Cal Grant B recipients who are exempt 
from paying nonresident tuition and complete community or volunteer service at a qualifying organization. 
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM 
The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students of no more than 40 percent of 
the UC or CSU mandatory systemwide tuition and fees. 
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS 
The California Chafee Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 to eligible foster youth who are enrolled in college or 
vocational school at least half-time.  New and renewal awards are made based on available funding. 
The California Military Department GI Bill Award Program provides funding for active members of the California National Guard, 
the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia who seek a certificate, degree, or diploma.  Recipients attending the UC, CSU or 
a private institution may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant A award.  Recipients attending a community college may 
receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant B award.  An award used for graduate studies may not exceed the maximum amount 
of a Cal Grant A award plus $500 for books and supplies. 
 
The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents (LEPD) Scholarship Program provides college grants equivalent to Cal Grant 
amounts to dependents of California law enforcement officers, officers and employees of the Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation, and firefighters killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. 
The Golden State Teacher Grant Program provides one-time grants of $20,000 to students enrolled in a teacher preparation 
program who commit to teaching in high-need fields at a qualifying school. 
LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAMS 
The Assumption Program of Loans for Education (APLE) issues agreements for loan assumptions to students and district 
interns who are pursuing careers in teaching and credentialed teachers teaching at certain schools.  A participant who teaches

a total of four years can receive up to $11,000 for outstanding student loans.  APLE participants who teach in the areas of 
math, science, or education specialist instruction in a school ranked in the lowest 60 percentile of the API may receive an 
additional $1,000 per year in loan assumption benefits.  Participants meeting this requirement who provide teaching service in 
a public school ranked in the lowest 20 percentile of the API may receive an additional $1,000 per year.  The total possible loan 
assumption benefit is $19,000. 
The State Nursing Assumption Program of Loans for Education for Nursing Faculty (SNAPLE NF) allows the state to issue 
agreements for loan assumption to persons who have completed at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing or a field related to 
nursing and agreed to teach at one or more regionally-accredited, eligible California colleges or universities.  A participant can 
receive up to $8,333 annually for three years toward outstanding student loans for a total loan assumption of up to $25,000. 
The John R. Justice Program provides loan repayments to eligible recipients currently employed as California prosecutors or 
public defenders who commit to continued employment in that capacity for at least three years.  Recipients may receive up to 
$5,000 of loan repayment disbursed annually to their lending institutions. 
OUTREACH PROGRAMS 
The California Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal-SOAP), through intersegmental consortia, provides financial aid 
outreach and tutoring services to disadvantaged K-12 students, increases their access to postsecondary education, and 
informs students about opportunities for career technical education.  Cal-SOAP also assists the matriculation of community 
college students to four-year institutions. 
Cash for College provides financial aid workshops to assist low-income students with completing the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid and the Cal Grant GPA Verification Form and understanding financial aid. 
5770 - EVERY KID COUNTS ACT 
The Every Kid Counts Act Program provides local and regional organizations with funds to match investment in or incentives 
for individual family college savings accounts and establishes outreach efforts to educate families about local college savings 
accounts. 
5775 - CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRANT PROGRAM 
The Child Savings Account Grant Program provides grants to support local governments and nonprofit organizations that 
sponsor or create local or regional child savings account programs.
