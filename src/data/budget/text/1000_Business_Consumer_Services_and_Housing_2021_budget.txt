The Cannabis Control Appeals Panel (Panel) was established pursuant to the November 2016 voter approved Proposition 64,

Regulation and Safety Act.  The Panel is organized under the Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency and consists 
of five members, one appointed by the Senate, one appointed by the Assembly, and three appointed by the Governor, subject 
to confirmation by the Senate. 
The Panel provides a forum of appeal for individuals to address licensing decisions made by a cannabis licensing authority 
relating to any penalty assessment, denial, transfer, condition, suspension, revocation, or other disciplinary action of 
annual cannabis licenses.  The Panel streamlines the appeals process, and provides expertise and due process in the review 
of licensing decisions.

1111   Department of Consumer Affairs 
The Department of Consumer Affairs (Department) is responsible for promoting and protecting the interests of millions of 
California consumers by serving as a guardian and advocate for their health, safety, and economic well-being and by promoting 
legal and ethical standards of professional conduct. The Department helps promote good business practices and ensure 
California's consumers receive quality services by establishing minimal competency standards for approximately 250 
professions and occupations involving more than three million professionals. The Department is also an important advocate on 
consumer and business issues. In general, the Department's Boards and Bureaus provide exams and licensing, enforcement, 
complaint resolution, and education for consumers. 
In addition, the Department provides centralized services for efficiency. Specifically, Department staff investigate complaints 
against licensees; develop valid examinations for applicants for licensure; monitor and advocate for legislation; provide 
consumer education and outreach; provide legal and audit services; and provide general administrative support involving 
personnel, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, and space management. 
There are currently 26 boards, one committee, and one commission under the broad authority of the Department, and eight 
bureaus and one certification program under the direct oversight of the Department. The Bureau of Cannabis Control will be 
consolidated, along with the state’s other cannabis licensing entities, into the Department of Cannabis Control effective July 1, 
2021.

Bureau of Cannabis Control, the Department of Food and Agriculture, and the Department of Public Health into a new stand-

• Fee Waiver or Deferral Program—The Budget includes $30 million one-time General Fund in 2021-22 to implement a fee 
waiver or deferral program pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 852, Statutes of 2019 (SB 595), to reduce barriers to entry

facilitating greater equity in business ownership and employment in the cannabis market. The Budget includes $15.5 million

commissioners to review, evaluate, and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence 
earthquake safety policies. 
The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that 
support the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. These activities include: (1) developing and 
reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing a consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related 
legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies, 
where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and 
supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery. 
The Budget reflects the transfer of the Commission to the Office of Emergency Services beginning in 2020-21, consistent with 
Chapter 20, Statutes of 2020 (AB 100).

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• The Budget includes a net zero shift of funding included in the 2020 Budget Act for the statewide implementation of safety 
review panels at all California racetracks from the Horse Racing Fund to the newly established Horse and Jockey Safety and 
Welfare Account. This funding shift provides a reprieve to the racing associations that have experienced significant financial 
hardships due a decline in wagering, intermittent closures required to implement safety enhancements, and extensive racing 
restrictions and closures due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS

The objective of this program is to protect the public's health, safety, and general welfare in buildings and structures designed 
for human occupancy through the enforcement of the California Health and Safety Code, including the State Housing Law, 
Employee Housing Act, Mobilehome Parks Act, Special Occupancy Parks Act, California Factory-Built Housing Law, and the 
Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act. HCD works with factory and site-built building industries, stakeholders, and other 
government agencies to review and propose the adoption of international, national, and uniform building codes as the basis for 
all residential construction in California. The program also enforces federal and state standards for the construction, safety, 
sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars.

and affordable housing for lower-income households, (2) promote economic, community, and job development by awarding 
state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and (4) monitor 
funding recipients for compliance with the terms of their contracts with the state.

cost of funds and charging fees to cover its lending costs and risks. The objective of CalHFA's lending activity is to advance the 
creation and preservation of affordable housing using various lending models that facilitate: (1) mortgage loans to qualified low 
and moderate income homebuyers to finance the purchase of an affordable home, (2) permanent loans to create and preserve 
multifamily housing projects for low and moderate income residents, and (3) special needs housing loans to facilitate the 
construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing needed to serve special needs populations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
1700 - DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE 
The Department of Real Estate ensures that individuals who wish to engage in real estate business and act in the capacity of, 
or advertise as, a real estate broker or salesperson within California meet specified qualifications, and makes sure licensees 
meet minimum education standards and requirements.  The Department investigates the actions of any person acting in the 
capacity of a real estate licensee, performs financial compliance audits of licensees and subdividers, administratively 
prosecutes violations of the Real Estate Law and Subdivided Lands Law, and provides victims of real estate fraud with financial 
recovery per limitations set by statute.  The Department protects the public against fraud and misrepresentation in the sale or 
lease of subdivided land through the issuance of public reports that disclose vital information to prospective purchasers of 
subdivision interests.
