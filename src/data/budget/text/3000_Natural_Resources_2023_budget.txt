Natural 
Resources 
Natural Resources Agency programs protect and 
restore California's diverse natural and cultural 
resources for current and future generations, 
including operating state parks, managing water 
supplies, supporting forest health, encouraging 
clean energy, and preserving fish and wildlife 
habitats, rich farmlands and mineral resources. 
Agency programs also protect the public through 
construction and maintenance of levees in the 
Central Valley and suppression of wildfires. These 
programs not only contribute to the state's unique 
quality of life, but also are critical to sustaining a 
vibrant economy. 
3100   Exposition Park 
The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are 
located in Exposition Park, a 152-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these 
three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park. 
The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park 
usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of 
the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, preserve, 
and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the 
western United States. 
Because the Science Center's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Science Center has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER 
 
Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and 
family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops 
and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 
Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological 
processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering, 
communications, and transportation, on land and in space. The Science Center’s Air and Space Center, the permanent home 
for the Space Shuttle Endeavour, will be constructed by the California Science Center Foundation. In July 2021, the Foundation 
reached the fundraising threshold required to begin construction. The entire bond financing process was completed in October 
2021, and construction is expected to begin in early 2022. 
In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The 
Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and 
other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a 
Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The 
school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 
The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those 
traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding 
support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation. 
2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT 
The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management 
and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events, 
and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is 
responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of 
park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park 
Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in 
addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood. 
2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM 
The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the 
Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of 
African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African 
American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear 
campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility 
in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public 
programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture, 
historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and 
to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at 
large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty 
years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an 
inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.

3125   California Tahoe Conservancy 
The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational 
resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs 
that acquire environmentally sensitive land; provide grants for or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed 
restoration; and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy balances 
these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by 
acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 
The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to 
restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.  The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the 
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed 
to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 
Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program 
to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 
The Conservancy manages nearly 4,700 state-owned properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of 
quarter-acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, 
and have significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple 
benefits and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and 
encroachments. Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental 
role of the Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational 
amenities, including 6 beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe. 
The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to 
more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a 
wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also 
increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire, 
clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This 
work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change.

NATURAL RESOURCES
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site 
improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating 
public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake. 
2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 
This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing 
facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide 
variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds 
such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality. 
In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting 
urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive 
Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town 
center objectives.  Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other 
environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

The California Tahoe Conservancy manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife habitat, 
watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary implementer 
of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake Tahoe Basin - a 
1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local 
governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

3210   Environmental Protection Program 
The California Environmental Protection Program receives revenue from the sale of personalized motor vehicle license plates 
by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Revenues are deposited in the California Environmental License Plate Fund. Funds 
expended pursuant to Division 13.5 of the Public Resources Code must have one or more of the following purposes: 
• The control and abatement of air pollution, including all phases of research into the sources, dynamics and effects of 
environmental pollutants. 
• The acquisition, preservation, restoration, or any combination thereof, of natural areas or ecological reserves. 
• Environmental education, including formal school programs and informal public education programs. 
• Protection of nongame species and threatened and endangered plants and animals. 
• Protection, enhancement, and restoration of fish and wildlife habitat and related water quality, including review of the 
potential impact of development activities and land use changes on that habitat. 
• The purchase, on an opportunity basis, of real property consisting of sensitive natural areas for the state park system and for 
local and regional parks. 
• Reduction or minimization of the effects of soil erosion and the discharge of sediment into the waters of the Lake Tahoe 
region, including the restoration of disturbed wetlands and stream environment zones. 
The appropriations and expenditures for programs and projects funded from the California Environmental License Plate Fund 
are contained in the budgets of the various state boards, commissions and departments.

3340   California Conservation Corps 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires, 
floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at 
public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become 
strong workers and citizens. 
In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that 
are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities. 
Because the CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on the CCC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2360 - TRAINING AND WORK PROGRAM 
This Program focuses on four areas: 
Natural Resource Work: Corpsmembers protect and enhance the state's natural resources through park development, trail 
construction, tree planting, fire hazard reduction, watershed improvement, wildlife habitat enhancement, removal of non-native 
vegetation, meadow restoration, energy and water auditing and retrofitting, irrigation system installation, and drought-tolerant 
and other landscaping. 
Disaster Response: Corpsmembers are dispatched to fires, assisting with initial attack, mop-up and logistical support; floods, 
filling sandbags, reinforcing levees and stabilizing hillsides; earthquakes, removing hazards and staffing disaster assistance 
centers; oil spill clean-up; snow removal; search and rescue operations; pest infestation eradication; and homeland security 
assistance. 
Corpsmember Education: Corpsmembers are provided opportunities to advance their academic skills while in the CCC through 
local adult and charter schools and community colleges. 
Corpsmember Development and Training: The CCC stresses the development of both a work and service ethic, which includes 
teamwork, self-discipline, leadership, and giving back to California. Corpsmembers learn conservation principles and career 
planning. The CCC also offers training in trail building, first aid, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, and 
firefighting certification, which can lead to internship opportunities with various employers in California.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 10 residential and 16 non-residential 
facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training, 
and educational opportunities to young adults. The facilities also allow the CCC to assist federal, state and local agencies, as 
well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources. 
The CCC residential facilities house 80 to 100 corpsmembers each and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people 
together from across the state, and increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential 
centers range in size from 30 to 60 corpsmembers and are located in both urban and rural communities throughout California.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2370 - REGULATION OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY 
Established pursuant to Chapter 81, Statutes of 2019 (AB 111), the Office is the successor to the Wildfire Safety Division of the 
California Public Utilities Commission as of July 1, 2021 and is authorized to: 
• Oversee and enforce electrical corporations’ compliance with wildfire safety pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 
8385) of Division 4.1. 
• In consultation with the California Wildfire Safety Advisory Board, develop and recommend to the commission performance 
metrics to achieve maximum feasible risk reduction to be used to develop the wildfire mitigation plan and evaluate an 
electrical corporation’s compliance with that plan. 
• Develop a field audit program for wildfire mitigation plan compliance by each electrical corporation. 
• Consult with the Office of Emergency Services in the office’s management and response to utility public safety power shutoff 
events and utility actions for compliance with public safety power shutoff program rules and regulations. 
• Support efforts to assess and analyze fire weather data and other atmospheric conditions that could lead to catastrophic

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 
This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 
tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and 
the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets; and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal, 
state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about 
land use, seismic safety, and mineral development. 
2425 - GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as much 
as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and 
environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of 
hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for 
program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries.    
2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION 
This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program 
provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local 
governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts 
for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development 
rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops 
maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to assist in local land use 
decisions. 
2435 - MINE RECLAMATION 
This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface 
Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim 
mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and 
remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of 
mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine 
Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans, 
and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to 
comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local 
government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 
The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue, and 
disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership in the protection of life, property, and natural resources in 
California. 
CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety 
programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency 
response. 
CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing 
diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention 
awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management. 
CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to 
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland 
areas of California. 
Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal protects life and property through the development and application of fire prevention, 
engineering, education, enforcement, and regulations. 
2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal: 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) is comprised of the following six divisions: 
• Code Development and Analysis: The Code Development and Analysis division is responsible for the development and 
adoption of codes relating to fire and life safety used statewide by architects, engineers, design professionals, and the local 
fire and building authorities. This division fosters, promotes, and develops ways and means of protecting life and property 
against fire in many ways, including the adoption and implementation of regulations for statewide application. This division 
prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations and building standards for review and adoption into the California Code of 
Regulations, titles 19 and 24.  The division assists local fire departments, fire districts, and building departments with the 
application of state laws and regulations.  This division also reviews all of California's regulations relating to fire and life 
safety for relevancy, necessity, conflict, duplication, and overlap. 
• Fire and Life Safety: The Fire and Life Safety division is responsible for applying laws and regulations related to fire 
prevention and life safety in state-owned and state-occupied facilities. This is achieved through code compliance inspections 
of new and existing buildings and plan review and construction inspections. The OSFM is responsible for fire and life safety 
in over 45,000 state-owned and state-occupied facilities, which include: state prisons, conservation camps, courts, state 
mental hospitals, state developmental centers, California State University and University of California campuses, and 
California Agricultural Districts. 
• Fire Engineering and Investigations: The Fire Engineering and Investigations division’s primary functions include licensing, 
product approval, fire/explosion investigations, and illegal fireworks enforcement and disposal. The division is responsible for 
11 statewide programs, which include the Building Materials Listing; Portable Fire Extinguishers; Flame Retardant Chemicals 
and Fabrics; Vapor Recovery; Automatic Fire Extinguishing Systems; Fire Safe Cigarettes; Licensing Enforcement and 
Inspection; Lab Accreditation; Motion Picture and Entertainment; Arson and Bomb Investigation; and Fireworks Disposal. 
This division also oversees the Arson and Bomb Unit, which has the responsibility to dispose of seized illegal fireworks and 
conduct fire/explosion investigations and licensing enforcement. 
• Pipeline Safety: The Pipeline Safety division ensures the safe construction, operation, and maintenance of approximately 
5,400 miles of intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines that transport crude oil, refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, 
etc.), and Highly Volatile Liquids through populated urban areas, ecologically sensitive areas, and other high consequence 
areas. Pipelines that fall under the Pipeline Safety division authority are pipelines that transport hazardous liquids between 
facilities, such as offshore platforms, production fields, refineries, storage terminals, and marine terminals. This division is 
additionally charged with implementing investigations for failures, explosions, and fires on intrastate pipelines, and assisting 
on investigations for interstate pipelines.  The Certified Unified Program Agencies program is responsible for ensuring the 
implementation of the California Fire Code Hazardous Materials Management Plan/Hazardous Materials Inventory 
Statement (HMMP/HMIS) and the Aboveground Petroleum Storage Act program elements.  The HMMP/HMIS program ties 
in closely with the Hazardous Release Response Plan and Inventory or Hazardous Materials Business Plan program.  The 
Firefighter Equipment and Foam program is tasked to monitor the use of Perfluoroalky and Polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS) throughout the state at designated facilities, issue waivers to refineries and terminals for fixed suppression systems 
meeting identified criteria. 
• State Fire Training: The State Fire Training division administers the California Fire Service Training and Education System 
and the Fire Service Training and Education Program for federal, state, and local firefighters. The division oversees a 
California Fire Academy System for over 65 training academies that represent a partnership with the fire departments, 
community colleges, and the OSFM. State Fire Training administers a professional certification system for fire service 
personnel and receives program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services. 
• Wildfire Planning and Engineering: The Wildfire Planning and Engineering division will be transitioning into the new 
Community Wildfire Preparedness and Mitigation Division established by the passage of Chapter 225, Statutes of 2021 (AB 
9). The division is responsible for various community-level fire prevention and preparedness programs including defensible 
space, home hardening, fire planning, land use planning, utility fire mitigation, fire prevention grants, fire hazard mapping, 
incident data and statistics, and damage inspection.

2461019 - California Underground Facilities Safe Excavation Board: 
Also called the “Dig Safe Board,” created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661), the Board works on 
issues related to the state's "Call Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators and buried infrastructure owners to coordinate 
to prevent infrastructure damage and unsafe outcomes.  The Dig Safe Board is charged with coordinating the state’s safe 
excavation outreach and education efforts, developing safe excavation standards, investigating accidents and working with 
partner state agencies to enforce the “Call Before You Dig” law.  The Dig Safe Board was transferred to the Office of Energy 
Infrastructure Safety on January 1, 2022 to comply with the requirements of Chapter 307, Statutes of 2020 (SB 865). 
2465 - FIRE PROTECTION 
CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property, and natural resources within social, political, and economic 
constraints.  The objective is to attack fires quickly and aggressively in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct 
protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract, or agreement until the fire is under control.  The level of initial attack and 
follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires within the first 
burning period. 
2465010 - Fire Prevention: 
This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression 
cost recovery, and fire prevention education.  This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials, and procedures 
to mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires.  More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to 
be done before a wildland fire starts to reduce the costs of firefighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire fighters, and 
damage to the environment. 
2465019 - Fire Control: 
The objective of this program is to detect, respond to, and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility 
Area.  The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy.  CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 
10 acres or less.  This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack, and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews, 
bulldozers, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft. 
2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection: 
CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state, and federal agencies throughout California 
through the administration of over 100 cooperative fire protection service agreements.  Additionally, there are six long standing 
agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department. 
2465037 - Conservation Camps: 
CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Parole Operations and 
Division of Juvenile Justice, operates 30 conservation camps throughout the state with capacity to house 152 fire crews.  CAL 
FIRE operates seven permanent Fire Centers, six seasonal Fire Centers, and one Parole Training Center with the California 
Conservation Corps throughout the state that house 28 fire crews.  CAL FIRE also operates in conjunction with the California 
National Guard to staff seven Fire Centers with a total of 10 fire crews.  Additionally, CAL FIRE is currently authorized to 
operate 16 CAL FIRE Firefighter Crews located at seven different Fire Centers.  These crews are available to respond to all 
types of emergencies including wildfires, floods, search and rescue, and earthquakes.  When not responding to emergencies, 
the crews engage in hazardous fuels reduction, conservation related work projects, and prescribed fire project work to protect 
the community and resources of California. 
2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 
CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope 
with a wildland fire within the initial attack period.  Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was 
incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency or through cost shares provided by other government entities.  In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of this cost 
through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes. 
2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands, and urban forests provide multiple human, climate, and 
environmental benefits.  The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to 
these resources from natural catastrophes and human development.  Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting, 
coordination of climate and forest restoration related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial 
landowners, operation of state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects, and 
administration of federal forestry assistance programs. 
2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement:

economic benefits of urban forests consistent with the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978; and (11) purchase and monitoring 
of working forest conservation easements per the California Forest Legacy Act of 2008.  In the area of vegetation management, 
assistance is provided to public and private landowners to achieve land use objectives by reducing damage from wildland fires, 
increase wildlife habitat, increase productivity of forest and rangelands, improve water yields and air quality, reduce carbon 
emissions from wildland fires, increase firefighter safety, and maintain desirable ecosystems. 
CAL FIRE cooperates with federal, state and local agencies, local organizations, and private property owners to develop and 
achieve land use objectives.  Activities include removal, rearrangement, conversion, or improvement of vegetation using 
various treatment measures such as prescribed fire and mechanical, manual, and biological methods.  The Environmental 
Protection Program provides in-house expertise and oversight of the Department's compliance with the California 
Environmental Quality Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and other environmental laws and regulations applicable to 
departmental actions.  The Climate and Energy program represents the Department in Natural and Working Lands and Climate 
Change Scoping Plan planning. 
2470019 - Forest Practice Regulations: 
The objective of this program is to maximize sustained production of high-quality timber products while protecting soil, water, 
wildlife, recreation, and other values associated with forest land.  Forest Practice activities include the review and permitting of 
commercial timber harvesting operations on nonfederal timberlands, enforcing state forest practice laws and regulations, and 
monitoring compliance and the effects of timber operations on forest productivity, water quality, watersheds, soils, botanical 
resources, wildlife, fisheries, greenhouse gases, and other environmentally sensitive resources.  The program is also 
responsible for issuing licenses to timber operators (LTOs), providing LTO training and education, and assisting the Board of 
Equalization-Timber Tax Division in their administration of taxes on timber and timberland.  Forest Practice program staff also 
assist the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, and facilitate and participate in monitoring the effectiveness of the Board's 
forest practice regulations. 
2470028 - Forest Resource Inventory and Assessment: 
The objective of this program is to perform a periodic assessment of California's forest and rangeland resources.  Activities 
include maintaining and distributing mission-critical datasets for fire planning, emergency incident support, and meeting certain 
regulatory requirements.  In addition, the program provides extensive technical and public information for statewide fire threat, 
fire hazard, watersheds, socio-economic conditions, environmental indicators, and urban forestry. 
2470037 - Professional Foresters Registration Program: 
The Office of Professional Foresters Registration is a statutorily authorized program within the Board of Forestry and Fire 
Protection.  The program is responsible for the licensing and regulation of all persons who practice forestry on non-federal, 
state, and private lands in California pursuant to the Professional Foresters Law of 1972.  The program also licenses “certified 
specialties” of forestry, with the single certified specialty currently being Certified Rangeland Managers.

3560   State Lands Commission 
The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its 
care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access. 
Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars in 
revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources. 
Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands 
Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign 
public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal 
government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands 
legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These trust grants encourage responsible development, 
environmental preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law 
Public Trust Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the 
trust to the benefit of all Californians. 
Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and 
lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high 
water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands, 
which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California. 
School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the 
five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state 
ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest 
in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands. 
Because the State Lands Commission’s (SLC) programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, SLC has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the SLC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Mineral Resources Management Division oversees the efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands. 
The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the 
safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas, 
geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public 
safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources 
through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also implements various programs for the prevention of oil 
spills and the safe operation of offshore facilities and conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives 
fair value for the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the 
oil and gas facilities under its jurisdiction. 
Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-
generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects. The Commission also coordinates with other agencies to 
administer the statewide Abandoned Mines Program. 
2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural 
and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public 
Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from Lake 
Tahoe and the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast in the west, and include California’s 
two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California Legislature to approximately 70 local 
jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including the state’s five major ports. The 
Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for use or development, preserving 
and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands. 
Finally, the Commission manages the state’s school lands, which seeks to develop and consolidate the state’s school-land 
holdings to the economic benefit of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. 
2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION 
The Marine Environmental Protection Division regulates marine oil terminals within California, providing the best achievable 
protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Division monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, 
inspects all marine facilities, and reviews and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification 
programs. The Division also administers Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit 
for their purpose, and implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous 
species into California waters through the operations of oceangoing vessels. The program funds and conducts scientific 
research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing 
vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions. 
9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction, and administrative support to the 
Commission’s line programs.

3600   Department of Fish and Wildlife 
The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the 
habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological value and for their use and enjoyment by the public. 
This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to protect the survival of species and 
natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational, 
commercial, scientific, and educational uses. 
Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages more than 740 properties statewide, comprising more than 1 million acres 
(approximately 679,000 acres of state-owned land and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the 
Department. Several state agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management 
responsibilities for these properties are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department 
control continues to increase. Examples of the properties managed by the Department include, and are not limited to: 111 
wildlife areas, 136 ecological reserves, 138 public access areas, and 21 fish hatcheries. 
3640   Wildlife Conservation Board 
The Wildlife Conservation Board protects, restores and enhances California's natural resources for wildlife and for the public's 
use and enjoyment in partnership with conservation groups, government agencies and the people of California.

3720   California Coastal Commission 
The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed by the Governor, the Senate Rules 
Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the 
California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and 
recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources; 
and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. The Commission is also designated the 
principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone Management Act in 
California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal development projects, 
and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be subject to state control.

permanently retained jurisdiction (e.g., tidelands, submerged lands, and public trust lands) and limited categories of local 
coastal development permit actions that can be appealed to the Commission. 
• Monitoring and enforcement of coastal development permits. 
• Reviewing federal activities for consistency with the Coastal Act. 
• Protecting and expanding opportunities for public coastal access and recreation. 
• Implementing a coastal water quality protection program. 
• Providing technical information and assistance to support effective coastal management. 
• Implementing a coastal and ocean resource public education program. 
• Addressing coastal energy issues including, but not limited to, offshore oil and gas development, offshore wind projects,

3790   Department of Parks and Recreation 
The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and 
education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most 
valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and 
future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the 
major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural 
resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park 
visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and 
water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, 
jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds, 
plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing 
financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies. 
Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

3820   San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission 
The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional 
authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance the San Francisco Bay, and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive 
use. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan, and relies on the McAteer-Petris Act and other 
statutory and regulatory authorities to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The Commission issues permits 
for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and within salt ponds and certain 
managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. By 
statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay and 
exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The Commission leads the ongoing multi-
agency regional effort to address the impacts of rising sea level and climate change on the Bay and along the shoreline.

The San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy was established in 1999 to acquire and manage 
public lands. Through these acquisitions, the Conservancy provides for additional open space, low-impact recreational uses, 
educational uses, water conservation and watershed improvement, and wildlife and habitat restoration and protection. These 
acquisitions also help to preserve the San Gabriel Mountains and the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and their 
tributaries, consistent with existing and adopted river and flood control projects for the protection of life and property.

3845   San Diego River Conservancy 
The mission of the San Diego River Conservancy is to implement the San Diego River Conservancy Act through programs 
emphasizing Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Natural and Cultural Resources, Water Quality and Natural Flood 
Conveyance, Organizational Capacity, and the San Diego Rivers Watershed Consortium. This Conservancy’s mission will be 
accomplished in part by building with our partners the San Diego River Trail stretching over 52 miles from the headwaters in 
Julian to the Pacific Ocean. The Conservancy has established advisory panels to assist in restoring and enhancing three 
nearby watersheds: the Otay River, Sweetwater River, and Tijuana River. Working with stakeholders within these watersheds 
fosters collaboration among governments, public agencies and nonprofit organizations, and leverages grant funding to achieve 
an array of conservation objectives for the region with an emphasis on native habitat restoration and mitigating the impacts of 
climate change, seawater intrusion in local watersheds, sea level rise, and the risk of wildfire and flooding.

3860   Department of Water Resources 
The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water supply. The Department 
evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs, and explores potential solutions to meet the state’s growing 
needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to 
prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its 
efficient use. 
 
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 
The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water 
resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to 
consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water 
conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water 
supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan 
identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation, 
recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration, 
groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected 
catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare 
integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure 
sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development, 
protection of agriculture, and supporting a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water 
Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local 
agencies and tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination. 
3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 
The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21 
pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals, 
pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. 
2023-24 STATE BUDGET — RES 208
3860   Department of Water Resources - Continued
NATURAL RESOURCES
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water 
to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County. 
The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe, 
timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental 
commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and 
federal regulations and permits. 
3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE 
This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper 
construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include 
assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use 
of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities, 
coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in 
cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way 
for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and the 
reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities 
associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The 
program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety. 
3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD 
The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control (SPFC) facilities, 
designated floodways, and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by 
issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that 
protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large 
joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than 100 local maintaining agencies that operate and 
maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for 
stakeholders. 
3255 - SERVICES 
This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning, 
development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory; 
information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies. 
3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY BOND OFFICE 
California Energy Bond Office is responsible for managing the Electrical Power Fund and the Department of Water Resources 
(DWR) Charge Fund. In response to the 2001 California energy crisis, for a limited period of time, the Electrical Power Charge 
Fund purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities and issued $11.3 billion in bonds. The final 
amount of the outstanding bonds were defeased in September 2020. Bond proceeds were used to repay amounts borrowed for 
power purchases during the 2001 energy crisis.  The DWR Charge Fund was created in 2019 by Chapter 79, Statutes of 2019 
(AB 1054) to collect remittances from charges on investor-owned utilities ratepayers pursuant to Water Code Section 80550.

The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control 
system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage 
facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 
miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated 
farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate 
reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the 
Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank 
protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs, 
pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood 
protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

3885   Delta Stewardship Council 
Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is 
to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and 
enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and 
enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted 
a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta. 
Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other 
relevant agencies. The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent 
Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to 
inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
