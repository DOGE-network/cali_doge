PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6275025 - COUNTY ASSESSMENT STANDARDS PROGRAM 
The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human 
resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's County 
Assessment Standards program. This program ensures that taxable properties are enrolled and assessed, and that the 58 
county assessors assess all properties. 
6275050 - STATE-ASSESSED PROPERTY PROGRAM 
The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human 
resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's State-Assessed 
Property program. This program is responsible for valuing and assessing inter-county pipelines and properties owned or used 
by railroads, regulated telephone companies, companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity, and private railroad car 
companies. Local jurisdictions use the established values for the levy and collection of local property taxes. 
6275075 - TIMBER TAX PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the Timber Tax Fund. The revenue, less administrative costs, is allocated to the counties 
where the timber was harvested. The CDTFA administers and collects the Timber Yield Tax, a property tax paid by timber 
owners when they harvest trees or timber. The CDTFA determines the harvest values of timber and timberland production zone 
values. 
6275100 - SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM 
This program ensures that all sales and use tax revenues are collected in an equitable and effective manner through accurate 
reporting of tax liability. This is accomplished by detecting and correcting errors in self-assessments, and promptly collecting 
amounts determined to be due and economically recoverable. Under this program, the CDTFA administers the following taxes: 
State Sales and Use Tax, Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax, and District Transactions and Use Tax (cities/
counties). 
6275125 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TAX PROGRAM 
These programs provide revenue for the Hazardous Waste Control Account (HWCA), the Hazardous Waste Facilities Account 
(HWFA), and the Toxic Substances Control Account (TSCA). The fees provide funding to the Department of Toxic Substances 
Control (DTSC) to regulate hazardous waste in California. Generators of hazardous waste, hazardous waste facilities and 
certain business organizations, as identified by statute, are subject to the fees. CDTFA administers the following fee programs 
in partnership with DTSC: Disposal Fee (HWCA), Generator Fee/Generation and Handling Fee (HWCA), Transportable 
Treatment Unit Fee (HWCA), Facility Fee (HWCA-HWFA), and Environmental Fee (TSCA). 
6275150 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. The CDTFA collects the excise tax imposed on the 
sale, distribution, or importation of alcoholic beverages in California. The BOE contracts with the CDTFA to provide 
Administrative services for this program. 
6275175 - TIRE RECYCLING FEE PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the California Tire Recycling Account in the California Tire Recycling Management Fund 
and Air Pollution Control Fund. The fee provides funding to reduce air pollution, landfill disposal, and stockpiling of used tires. 
The CDTFA administers the program in partnership with the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, and 
the Air Resources Board. 
6275200 - CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS TAX PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the Cigarette Tax Fund, Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund, California 
Healthcare, Research and Prevention Tobacco Tax Act of 2016 Fund, the Breast Cancer Fund, and the California Children and 
Families First Trust Fund. The program objective is to ensure that the excise tax imposed on all cigarette,  and tobacco 
products are collected equitably and effectively by ensuring timely reporting and payment of tax liabilities, detecting and 
correcting reporting errors, and promptly collecting amounts determined to be due and economically recoverable. 
6275225 - CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS LICENSING PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Compliance Fund, which is used to implement, enforce, 
and administer the provisions of the California Cigarette and Tobacco Licensing Act of 2003. The Licensing Act required the 
CDTFA to establish a statewide licensure program to help stem the tide of untaxed distributions and illegal sales of cigarette 
and tobacco products and stamps. This program requires licensing of distributors, wholesalers, importers, manufacturers, and 
retailers of cigarette and tobacco products.

Proposition 19 on the November 2020 ballot.  CDTFA is responsible for determining each eligible local agency’s aggregate gain 
or loss in property taxes every three years, based on the amounts reported by the counties. Counties with a negative gain are 
eligible to receive a reimbursement from the County Revenue Protection Fund. If the County Revenue Protection Fund is

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6280 - TAX PROGRAMS 
This program administers the Revenue and Taxation Code by reasonably interpreting and impartially applying the legislatively 
enacted laws that provide a significant portion of General Fund revenue. The Franchise Tax Board is responsible for 
administering the personal income tax and the corporation tax. Tax program activities include taxpayer assistance and tax 
return processing, filing enforcement, audits, and tax collection functions. The program also includes the collection and 
distribution of voluntary contributions to, and on behalf of, certain non-profit charitable organizations. 
6285 - POLITICAL REFORM AUDIT 
 
This program determines the accuracy and completeness of political statements and reports filed with the Secretary of State, 
and compliance with disclosures and record keeping requirements. On behalf of the Fair Political Practices Commission 
(FPPC), and in compliance with the Political Reform Act of 1974, the Franchise Tax Board conducts field audits of state and 
local candidates, measures committees, lobbying entities, committees supporting and opposing political candidates and 
statewide measures. These entities are randomly selected by the FPPC and/or meet dollar thresholds. 
6290 - DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES COLLECTIONS PROGRAM 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent motor vehicle license fees, taxes, and penalties on behalf of 
the Department of Motor Vehicles by utilizing the same collection capabilities that are used to collect the personal income tax. 
6295 - COURT COLLECTION PROGRAM 
This program's objective is to increase collections of delinquent fines, penalties, and orders imposed by, and on behalf of, 
superior, municipal, and justice courts by utilizing the same automated collection capabilities that are used to collect the 
personal income tax. 
6300 - LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM 
This program reimburses the Department of Justice for legal services provided in support of Franchise Tax Board functions. 
6305 - CONTRACT WORK 
This program provides cost-effective goods and services to other governmental entities through contractual agreements. Such 
goods and services include rental space to on-site childcare and cafeteria entities, data processing services for other 
governmental entities, and delinquent debt collection services. 
9900100 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program provides executive leadership under the general direction of the Franchise Tax Board by directing departmental 
operations, developing and executing policies, making decisions concerning program operations, and ensuring that the Board's 
programs and services are carried out in accordance with Government Code sections 15701 and 15702. This program also 
provides the Board with the personnel, administration, training, budgeting, and accounting services necessary to ensure that 
these functions are performed with integrity, efficiency, and fairness.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES 
With a multi-billion-dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for 
inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in 
public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds 
are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public 
building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school 
districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e) 
Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California. 
6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and 
equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties. 
6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES 
Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid 
redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate 
space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring  protection of lives and 
property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified 
parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their 
programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies, 
and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and 
ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners. 
6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES 
To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are 
essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and 
leveraged procurement agreements for information technology and non-information technology goods and services, green and 
sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing 
small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing 
the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include 
travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy 
efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, telework compliance, and budget, accounting, and human

resources services. Additionally, state, and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct 
quasi-judicial hearings and mediations authorized by law. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This 
program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services, 
auditing, research, and strategic planning, public affairs, and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative 
services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, information technology, health and safety, and 
departmental procurement and contracting.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer 
financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a 
claim with the CalVCB for program benefits. 
6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM 
This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery 
of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community 
(the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition 
and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 
the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities. 
6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN PROGRAM 
This program reimburses persons for certain expenses who sustained injury or losses as a result of a direct action that 
benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

5/ The 2023 Budget Act estimates 2023-24 other expenditures to be $1,490,039,000, as approved by the CalPERS Board of 
Administration at its April 2023 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2023-24 Governor's Budget to the 2023 
Budget Act is primarily due to an increase in investment external management fees and technology expenses.

2/ This display does not reflect the $1.7 billion supplemental pension payment to the California Public Employees' 
Retirement System (CalPERS) in 2023-24 towards the unfunded liabilities of the state retirement plans that are included in 
the 2023 Budget Act. This display does not reflect the supplemental pension payments to CalPERS state plans included in 
the 2021 Budget Act or 2022 Budget Act.
1/ This display reflects fund data as of the 2023-24 Governor's Budget.
3/ The 2023 Budget Act estimates 2023-24 state contributions to CalPERS to be $7,727,968,000. The decrease in this 
estimate from the 2023-24 Governor's Budget to the 2023 Budget Act reflects a slight decrease in the state plans' 
employer contribution rate, as approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration at its April 2023 meeting.
4/ The 2023 Budget Act estimates 2023-24 administrative expenditures to be $476,118,000, as approved by the CalPERS 
Board of Administration at its April 2023 meeting. The increase to this estimate from the 2023-24 Governor's Budget to the 
2023 Budget Act reflects anticipated increases in personal services and operating expenses and equipment captured in 
the expenditures approved in April 2023.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6410 - RETIREMENT 
CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for 
employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of 
duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2022, there were about 1,381,000 active and inactive members, and 
about 775,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 
Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. 
There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter, 
California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract 
with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit 
formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions. 
As of June 30, 2022, there were 2,892 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and 
survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their 
careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency 
retirement systems. 
CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 
6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY 
CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the 
federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age, 
Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act.  As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the 
liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies.  The program is responsible for 
administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting 
and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 
6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 
The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee 
associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees, 
retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs, 
provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer 
representatives. 
Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic, 
Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all 
eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial 
intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 
6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 
Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the 
purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired 
members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees' 
Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $439.4 billion, as of June 30, 2022. 
6425 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of 
the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy 
Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term 
Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

7910   Office of Administrative Law 
The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state 
regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these 
regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also 
responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been 
recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through 
a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members 
of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 
In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies 
constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 
The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the 
California Regulatory Notice Register.

7920   State Teachers' Retirement System 
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution 
plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred 
compensation plans and programs: 
• State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP) 
• CalSTRS Pension2 Personal Wealth Plan (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans) 
• Teachers' Health Benefits Fund 
• Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund 
CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school 
teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of 
June 30, 2022, there were over one million members, retirees, and beneficiaries in the STRP Defined Benefit Program. 
CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement 
Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS 
CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the 
distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the 
largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement 
benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may 
modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the 
member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's 
retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or 
contract provisions. 
Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the 
General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of 
administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
