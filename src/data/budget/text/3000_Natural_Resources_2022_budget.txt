Natural 
Resources 
Natural Resources Agency programs protect and 
restore California's diverse natural and cultural 
resources for current and future generations, 
including operating state parks, managing water 
supplies, supporting forest health, encouraging 
clean energy, and preserving fish and wildlife 
habitats, rich farmlands and mineral resources. 
Agency programs also protect the public through 
construction and maintenance of levees in the 
Central Valley and suppression of wildfires. These 
programs not only contribute to the state's unique 
quality of life, but also are critical to sustaining a 
vibrant economy. 
3100   Exposition Park 
The Office of Exposition Park Management, the Science Center, and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are 
located in Exposition Park, a 152-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these 
three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park. 
The Office of Exposition Park Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park 
usage policy and day-to-day management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of 
the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science learning. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, preserve, 
and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the 
western United States. 
Because the Science Center's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Science Center has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Science Center's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER 
 
Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and 
family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops 
and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 
Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological 
processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering, 
communications, and transportation, on land and in space. The Science Center’s Air and Space Center, the permanent home 
for the Space Shuttle Endeavour, will be constructed by the California Science Center Foundation. In July 2021, the Foundation 
reached the fundraising threshold required to begin construction. The entire bond financing process was completed in October 
2021, and construction is expected to begin in early 2022. 
In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The 
Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and 
other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a 
Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The 
school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 
The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those 
traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding 
support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation. 
2305 - EXPOSITION PARK MANAGEMENT 
The Office of Exposition Park Management (OEPM) is responsible for public safety operations, parking services management 
and overall park beautification maintenance. In addition, OEPM administers supervision and coordination of park-wide events, 
and facilitates communication efforts between state, city, county, and private entities represented within the park. OEPM is 
responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including development of 
park facilities and future infrastructure improvements. OEPM is also responsible for managing the Exposition Park 
Improvement Fund and generating revenue to maintain the park. Exposition Park enriches the internal park community and in 
addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood.

The California African American Museum (CAAM) is governed by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the 
Governor. CAAM’s mission is to research, collect, preserve, and interpret, for public enrichment, the history, art, and culture of 
African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States. Founded in 1977, as the first African 
American museum of art, history, and culture fully supported by a state, CAAM was the direct result of a sustained, multiyear 
campaign of activism undertaken by visionary founders and community members. CAAM occupies a 44,000-square-foot facility 
in Exposition Park, which includes 15,000 square feet of gallery space and an additional 13,000 square feet of space for public 
programming. The museum’s permanent collection houses 4,000 objects that span paintings, photographs, film, sculpture, 
historical documents, and artifacts. CAAM has a strong mandate to support the work of under-represented artists of color and 
to think expansively about the way that people of the African diaspora have contributed to American culture and the world at 
large. That is achieved through a rotating exhibition schedule and public programming for visitors of all ages. More than forty 
years after its founding, the originating principle for CAAM remains vital to a healthy and just America--to create and support an 
inclusive, accessible, and dynamic space where all people can see black lives, culture, and experiences valued and reflected.

3125   California Tahoe Conservancy 
The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the natural and recreational 
resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing programs 
that acquire environmentally sensitive land; provide grants for or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed 
restoration; and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy balances 
these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by 
acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 
The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP), which is intended to 
restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.  The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the 
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed 
to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 
Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program 
to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 
The Conservancy owns and manages nearly 4,700 properties totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of quarter-
acre lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, and have 
significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple benefits 
and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and encroachments. 
Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental role of the 
Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational amenities, 
including 6 beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe. 
The Conservancy and its partners are increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects to 
more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a 
wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also 
increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire, 
clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This 
work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change. 
The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site 
improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating 
public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake. 
2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 
This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing 
facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide 
variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds 
such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting 
urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive 
Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town 
center objectives.  Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other 
environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California Tahoe Conservancy manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife habitat, 
watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary implementer 
of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake Tahoe Basin - a 
1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local 
governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

• The control and abatement of air pollution, including all phases of research into the sources, dynamics and effects of 
environmental pollutants. 
• The acquisition, preservation, restoration, or any combination thereof, of natural areas or ecological reserves. 
• Environmental education, including formal school programs and informal public education programs. 
• Protection of nongame species and threatened and endangered plants and animals. 
• Protection, enhancement, and restoration of fish and wildlife habitat and related water quality, including review of the 
potential impact of development activities and land use changes on that habitat. 
• The purchase, on an opportunity basis, of real property consisting of sensitive natural areas for the state park system and for 
local and regional parks. 
• Reduction or minimization of the effects of soil erosion and the discharge of sediment into the waters of the Lake Tahoe 
region, including the restoration of disturbed wetlands and stream environment zones. 
The appropriations and expenditures for programs and projects funded from the California Environmental License Plate Fund

3340   California Conservation Corps 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires, 
floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at 
public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become 
strong workers and citizens. 
In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that 
are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities. 
Because the CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on the CCC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 
DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY 
Public Resources Code Section 14000 - 14424. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
◦ Wildfire and Forest Resilience Package—The Budget includes $400 million General Fund in 2022-23 as part of a $1.2 
billion package of investments that target the state’s wildfire risks. Of the total $1.2 billion, $730 million will be allocated at 
a later time.  This includes $15 million in 2022-23 for the California Conservation Corps to invest in the Forestry Corps. 
◦ Enhancing and Expanding California Conservation Corps Fire Crews—The Budget includes $8.1 million General Fund, 
with an offsetting decrease of $1.8 million Collins-Dugan Reimbursement Account, to support additional CAL FIRE/Corps 
fire crews to enhance CAL FIRE’S fire prevention and suppression capabilities. 
◦ Equipment Replacement—The Budget includes $7.3 million one-time General Fund to replace a portion of an aging fleet, 
which are critical in transporting crews to project sites and emergency response locations. 
◦ Fire Crews—The Budget includes $1,769,000 General Fund in 2022-23, $1,708,000 in 2023-24, $1,994,000 ongoing, and 
11 positions, to: (1) right-size existing CCC crews, (2) convert 6 existing seasonal CCC crews to year-round crews, and (3) 
add 4 new year-round crews. These proposals will increase the overall number of permanent fire crews available to: (1) 
respond to wildfires throughout the year, (2) implement high-priority fuel reduction projects to protect communities from 
wildfire, and (3) participate in prescribed fire and other fuels treatment projects to achieve more resilient landscapes. This 
package builds upon existing partnerships and will partially offset the projected loss of Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation inmate crews.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2360 - TRAINING AND WORK PROGRAM 
This Program focuses on four areas: 
Natural Resource Work: Corpsmembers protect and enhance the state's natural resources through park development, trail 
construction, tree planting, fire hazard reduction, watershed improvement, wildlife habitat enhancement, removal of non-native 
vegetation, meadow restoration, energy and water auditing and retrofitting, irrigation system installation, and drought-tolerant 
and other landscaping. 
Disaster Response: Corpsmembers are dispatched to fires, assisting with initial attack, mop-up and logistical support; floods, 
filling sandbags, reinforcing levees and stabilizing hillsides; earthquakes, removing hazards and staffing disaster assistance 
centers; oil spill clean-up; snow removal; search and rescue operations; pest infestation eradication; and homeland security 
assistance. 
Corpsmember Education: Corpsmembers are provided opportunities to advance their academic skills while in the CCC through 
local adult and charter schools and community colleges. 
Corpsmember Development and Training: The CCC stresses the development of both a work and service ethic, which includes 
teamwork, self-discipline, leadership, and giving back to California. Corpsmembers learn conservation principles and career 
planning. The CCC also offers training in trail building, first aid, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, and 
firefighting certification, which can lead to internship opportunities with various employers in California.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 
This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 
tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and 
the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets; and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal, 
state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about 
land use, seismic safety, and mineral development.

2022-23 STATE BUDGET — RES 57
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to prevent, as much 
as possible, damage to life, health, property, and natural resources. The program seeks to protect public health and safety and 
environmental quality, including reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the development of 
hydrocarbon and geothermal resources in a manner that meets the energy needs of the state. The state is fully reimbursed for 
program expenditures by annual assessments and fees on the respective industries.    
2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION 
This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. The Williamson Act program 
provides advice on and reviews documents related to changes to Williamson Act contracts between landowners and local 
governments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts 
for planning purposes and for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development 
rights, and therefore development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program develops 
maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to assist in local land use 
decisions. 
2435 - MINE RECLAMATION 
This program regulates surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the Surface 
Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to reclaim 
mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned mines and 
remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety. 
2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD 
The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of 
mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The department's California Geological Survey and the Division of Mine 
Reclamation provide the Board with relevant engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for certain reports, plans, 
and maps. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notice of violation orders to 
comply, or administrative penalties and in cases where the Division of Mine Reclamation contests the adequacy of a local 
government’s approval of a mine operation’s financial assurance cost estimate.

3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 
The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue, and 
disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership in the protection of life, property, and natural resources in 
California. 
CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety 
programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency 
response. 
CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing 
diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention 
awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management. 
CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to 
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland 
areas of California. 
Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
Firefighter Fire Crews—The Budget includes $169 million General Fund in 2022-23, $164.3 million ongoing, and 827 
positions, phased in over four years, to staff and support 17 new Firefighter 1 crews and fund associated equipment and 
special repairs. This increase further supports firefighting capabilities and partially offsets the projected loss of Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation inmate crews. 
Wildfire and Forest Resilience Package—The Budget includes $50 million General Fund in 2021-22, $305 million ($200 
million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and $105 million General Fund) in 2022-23, as part of a $1.2 billion package of

investments that target the state’s wildfire risks. This includes funding for various program to support and implement projects 
related to wildfire and forest resilience. Of the $1.2 billion, $530 million will be allocated at a later time. 
Additional Fire Hawk Helicopters—The Budget includes $100 million General Fund in 2022-23, $12.7 million ongoing, and 5 
positions to purchase and operate four additional helicopters to support 24/7 operations of the enhanced helicopter fleet. 
California continues to invest in the acquisition and delivery of twelve S70i Fire Hawk helicopters, with 8 of 12 currently in 
California. These larger helicopters have the capability to drop up to 1,000 gallons of water at a time and operate at night, 
which can significantly slow advancing wildfires. The acquisition of four additional helicopters will provide additional aircraft 
availability to help maintain 24/7 flight operations during critical fire weather conditions when frontline helicopters are due for 
maintenance. 
Firefighter Relief Staffing—The Budget includes $97.2 million General Fund in 2022-23, $84.9 million ongoing, and 455 
positions, phased in over four years, to improve the health and wellness of CAL FIRE firefighters and appropriately staff CAL 
FIRE to meet the demands of wildland firefighting in a changing climate. Over the past decade, firefighters from CAL FIRE 
have battled and endured 14 of the 20 largest wildfires in the state's history. Current conditions appear to indicate above 
average wildfire severity and intensity will continue in the coming years. 
July through December 2022 Fire Protection Augmentation—The Budget includes $83.1 million General Fund one-time to 
augment CAL FIRE’s fire protection resources through December 2022 given current drought conditions, increasing fire 
severity and size, and declining inmate camp populations. 
Exclusive Use Type 1 Helitankers—The budget includes $52 million General Fund and 29 positions annually for three years 
to contract for 10 exclusive use helitankers each year while the state awaits the delivery of retardant dropping C-130 aircrafts 
from the federal government. CAL FIRE operates 12 state-owned firefighting helicopters, and 1 firefighting helicopter under 
contract with San Diego County, located strategically at 11 helitack bases across California. This proposal will augment the 
statewide aviation fleet with ten additional heavy helicopters, each capable of dropping 1,000-2,000 gallons of water at a time. 
Direct Mission Support—The Budget includes $37.8 million ($29.3 million General Fund) in 2022-23, $35.6 million ($27.5 
million General Fund) ongoing, and 190 positions to improve operational effectiveness by strengthening and enhancing the 
core administrative and program support critical to sustain CAL FIRE’s direct mission functions in an increasingly complex 
environment. 
Surge Equipment: Fire Engines and Bulldozers—The Budget includes $35.8 million General Fund in 2022-23 and $2.8 
million ongoing for surge capacity dozers and fire engines. CAL FIRE operates 356 frontline fire engines and 59 bulldozers 
across the state. This equipment requires regular maintenance and can have unexpected mechanical breakdowns. This 
proposal will add two surge engines per unit and contract county, and ten additional bulldozers, to provide additional resources 
that can be staffed during critical fire conditions and resource drawdown. 
Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System—The Budget includes $30 million ongoing General Fund, $5.6 million and 20 
positions in CAL FIRE's budget, to establish the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS) program to increase the 
real-time information and situational awareness available to the state and California’s mutual aid system responders and 
managers on all hazards events, including wildfires. FIRIS will utilize a combination of aircraft, high-definition real time video, 
and data analysis dispatched 24/7 throughout the state to provide nearly instantaneous, accurate visual situation awareness 
that informs public safety and emergency management operational and tactical decisions. Early detection and rapid intelligence 
allows for the strategic and efficient allocation of resources before, during, and after disaster incidents, and a more effective 
response to reduce loss of life and property. The intelligence gathered will also provide data and support to the Wildfire 
Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center, as established through SB 209 (Chapter 405, Statutes of 2019).

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal protects life and property through the development and application of fire prevention, 
engineering, education, enforcement, and regulations. 
2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal: 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) is comprised of the following six divisions: 
• Code Development and Analysis: The Code Development and Analysis division is responsible for the development and 
adoption of codes relating to fire and life safety used statewide by architects, engineers, design professionals, and the local 
fire and building authorities. This division fosters, promotes, and develops ways and means of protecting life and property 
against fire in many ways, including the adoption and implementation of regulations for statewide application. This division 
prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations and building standards for review and adoption into the California Code of 
Regulations, titles 19 and 24.  The division assists local fire departments, fire districts, and building departments with the 
application of state laws and regulations.  This division also reviews all of California's regulations relating to fire and life 
safety for relevancy, necessity, conflict, duplication, and overlap. 
• Fire and Life Safety: The Fire and Life Safety division is responsible for applying laws and regulations related to fire 
prevention and life safety in state-owned and state-occupied facilities. This is achieved through code compliance inspections 
of new and existing buildings and plan review and construction inspections. The OSFM is responsible for fire and life safety 
in over 45,000 state-owned and state-occupied facilities, which include: state prisons, conservation camps, courts, state 
mental hospitals, state developmental centers, California State University and University of California campuses, and 
California Agricultural Districts. 
• Fire Engineering and Investigations: The Fire Engineering and Investigations division’s primary functions include licensing, 
product approval, fire/explosion investigations, and illegal fireworks enforcement and disposal. The division is responsible for

National Guard to staff seven Fire Centers with a total of 10 fire crews.  Additionally, CAL FIRE is currently authorized to 
operate 16 CAL FIRE Firefighter Crews located at seven different Fire Centers.  These crews are available to respond to all 
types of emergencies including wildfires, floods, search and rescue, and earthquakes.  When not responding to emergencies, 
the crews engage in hazardous fuels reduction, conservation related work projects, and prescribed fire project work to protect 
the community and resources of California. 
2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 
CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope 
with a wildland fire within the initial attack period.  Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was 
incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency or through cost shares provided by other government entities.  In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of this cost 
through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes.

3560   State Lands Commission 
The California State Lands Commission provides effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, and resources entrusted to its 
care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and the promotion of public access. 
Execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted in the generation of billions of dollars in 
revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy these state lands and resources. 
Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands 
Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing approximately 4 million acres of California's sovereign 
public trust lands and resources, received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands that the federal 
government conveyed to the state (commonly known as school lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands 
legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These trust grants encourage responsible development, 
environmental preservation and enhancement, and public access on the state's tidelands, consistent with the common law 
Public Trust Doctrine. The grants typically require grantees to reinvest revenues generated from the granted lands back into the 
trust to the benefit of all Californians. 
Public trust, or sovereign lands, include the beds of natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and 
lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the ordinary high 
water mark seaward to the three-mile offshore limit. In addition to sovereign lands, the Commission manages school lands, 
which were granted to California by the federal government in 1853 for the purpose of supporting public education in California. 
School lands typically include the 16th and 36th sections of each township and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the 
five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, only about 458,843 acres remain in state 
ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest 
in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands. 
Because the State Lands Commission’s (SLC) programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, SLC has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the SLC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Mineral Resources Management Division oversees the efficient and safe development of mineral resources on state lands. 
The state also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oil fields, and as such, the Commission participates in the 
safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas, 
geothermal resources and other solid minerals; collect royalty and other revenues generated therefrom; and ensure that public 
safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these resources 
through engineering review and safety audits. The Commission also implements various programs for the prevention of oil 
spills and the safe operation of offshore facilities and conducts program and financial audits to ensure that the state receives 
fair value for the development of its resources. The Commission also manages the safe and effective decommissioning of the 
oil and gas facilities under its jurisdiction. 
Further, the Commission manages the mineral resources associated with school lands under its purview, including revenue-
generating extraction and prospecting leases and other projects. The Commission also coordinates with other agencies to 
administer the statewide Abandoned Mines Program. 
2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Land Management Division manages approximately 4 million acres of tide and submerged lands and the beds of natural 
and navigable rivers, streams, lakes, bays, estuaries, inlets, and straits. These lands, often referred to as sovereign or Public 
Trust lands, stretch from the Klamath River and Goose Lake in the north to the Tijuana Estuary in the south, and from Lake 
Tahoe and the Colorado River in the east, to three miles offshore from the Pacific Coast in the west, and include California’s 
two longest rivers, the Sacramento and San Joaquin. 
The Commission also monitors sovereign land granted in trust by the California Legislature to approximately 70 local 
jurisdictions that generally consist of prime waterfront lands and coastal waters, including the state’s five major ports. The 
Commission protects and enhances these lands and natural resources by issuing leases for use or development, preserving 
and expanding public access, and resolving boundaries between public and private lands. 
Finally, the Commission manages the state’s school lands, which seeks to develop and consolidate the state’s school-land 
holdings to the economic benefit of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System.

The Marine Environmental Protection Division regulates marine oil terminals within California, providing the best achievable 
protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Division monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, 
inspects all marine facilities, and reviews and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification 
programs. The Division also administers Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit 
for their purpose, and implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of nonindigenous 
species into California waters through the operations of oceangoing vessels. The program funds and conducts scientific 
research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing 
vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions. 
9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction, and administrative support to the 
Commission’s line programs.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California State Lands Commission operates five facilities statewide. Two are regional headquarters, each co-located with 
a field office, one located in Sacramento and the other in Long Beach. The three remaining facilities are field offices only, one in 
Northern California and two in Southern California. Of the five facilities, one is state-owned (Huntington Beach Field Office), 
and the other four are in leased space.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages more than 740 properties statewide, comprising more than 1 million acres 
(approximately 679,000 acres of state-owned land and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the 
Department. Several state agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management 
responsibilities for these properties are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department 
control continues to increase. Examples of the properties managed by the Department include, and are not limited to: 111 
wildlife areas, 136 ecological reserves, 138 public access areas, and 21 fish hatcheries.

3720   California Coastal Commission 
The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed by the Governor, the Senate Rules 
Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the 
California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and 
recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources; 
and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. The Commission is also designated the 
principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone Management Act in 
California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal development projects, 
and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be subject to state control.

3790   Department of Parks and Recreation 
The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and 
education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most 
valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and 
future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the 
major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural 
resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park 
visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and 
water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, 
jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds, 
plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing 
financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies. 
Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional 
authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance the San Francisco Bay, and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive 
use. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan, and relies on the McAteer-Petris Act and other 
statutory and regulatory authorities to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The Commission issues permits 
for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and within salt ponds and certain 
managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. By 
statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay and

3845   San Diego River Conservancy 
The mission of the San Diego River Conservancy is to implement the San Diego River Conservancy Act through programs 
emphasizing Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Natural and Cultural Resources, Water Quality and Natural Flood 
Conveyance, Organizational Capacity, and the San Diego Rivers Watershed Consortium. This Conservancy’s mission will be 
accomplished in part by building with our partners the San Diego River Trail stretching over 52 miles from the headwaters in 
Julian to the Pacific Ocean. The Conservancy has established advisory panels to assist in restoring and enhancing three 
nearby watersheds: the Otay River, Sweetwater River, and Tijuana River. Working with stakeholders within these watersheds 
fosters collaboration among governments, public agencies and nonprofit organizations, and leverages grant funding to achieve 
an array of conservation objectives for the region with an emphasis on native habitat restoration and mitigating the impacts of 
climate change, seawater intrusion in local watersheds, sea level rise, and the risk of wildfire and flooding.

3860   Department of Water Resources 
The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water supply. The Department 
evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs, and explores potential solutions to meet the state’s growing 
needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to 
prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its 
efficient use. 
 
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 
The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water 
resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to 
consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water 
conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water 
supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan 
identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation, 
recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration, 
groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected 
catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare 
integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure 
sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development, 
protection of agriculture, and supporting a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water 
Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local 
agencies and tribal governments improve water and land use planning coordination.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21 
pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals, 
pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. 
The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities that provide water 
to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County. 
The Delta Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe, 
timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the Delta Conveyance, project specific environmental 
commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and 
federal regulations and permits. 
3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE 
This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper 
construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for levee construction. Activities include 
assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use 
of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities, 
coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in 
cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way 
for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and the 
reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities 
associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The 
program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety. 
3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD 
The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control (SPFC) facilities, 
designated floodways, and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by 
issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that 
protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large 
joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than 100 local maintaining agencies that operate and 
maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for 
stakeholders. 
3255 - SERVICES 
This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning, 
development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory; 
information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies. 
3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY BOND OFFICE 
California Energy Bond Office is responsible for managing the Electrical Power Fund and the Department of Water Resources 
(DWR) Charge Fund. In response to the 2001 California energy crisis, for a limited period of time, the Electrical Power Charge 
Fund purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities and issued $11.3 billion in bonds. The final 
amount of the outstanding bonds were defeased in September 2020. Bond proceeds were used to repay amounts borrowed for 
power purchases during the 2001 energy crisis.  The DWR Charge Fund was created in 2019 by Chapter 79, Statutes of 2019 
(AB 1054) to collect remittances from charges on investor-owned utilities ratepayers pursuant to Water Code Section 80550.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control 
system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage 
facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 
miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated 
farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate 
reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the 
Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank 
protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs, 
pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood 
protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

3885   Delta Stewardship Council 
Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is 
to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and 
enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and 
enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted 
a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta. 
Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other 
relevant agencies. The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent 
Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to 
inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
