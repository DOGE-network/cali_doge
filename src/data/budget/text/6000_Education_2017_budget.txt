Education
Education programs provide academic services
segmented by elementary, secondary,
undergraduate and graduate programs as well
as credentialing services to ensure schools are
staffed with effective instructors.  Elementary
and secondary instruction is provided to all of
California's children to prepare them for higher
education or entry into the workforce.
Institutions of higher education provide further
access to the skills necessary for career goals
and participation in a globally competitive
workforce, as well as conducting research and
providing public services.
 
6100    Department of Education
 
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million
students.  Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Services for Administration,
Finance, Technology, and Infrastructure Branch; Instruction, Learning, and Support Branch; the Student Support and
Special Services Branch; the District, School and Innovation Branch; and the Legal and Audits Branch. 
 
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and
to work with the educational community to improve academic performance.  Major goals of the Department include: (a)
holding local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local
capacity to enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing,
and supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide
leadership that promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and
effectiveness in the administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management
practices, (f) providing broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g)
establishing and fostering systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and
intellectual support to help students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing
statewide leadership that promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve
students, and (j) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department. 
 
Because department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay
program to support this need.  For the specifics on the Department of Education's Capital Outlay Program, see
"Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The State Special Schools Division has six facilities under its jurisdiction: three residential schools and three diagnostic
centers. These facilities comprise a total of approximately 1,036,000 gross square feet on 167.29 acres. 
 
The residential schools serve students ranging in age from 3 to 22. They include Schools for the Deaf in Riverside and
Fremont and a School for the Blind in Fremont. The California Schools for the Deaf provide comprehensive educational
programs composed of academic, extracurricular, and residential activities for students. The California School for the Blind is
a statewide residential campus that provides intensive, disability-specific educational services for pupils who are blind,
visually impaired, or deaf-blind. The diagnostic centers are regionally located in Fresno, Fremont, and Los Angeles; the
centers address the unique educational needs of California's most difficult to serve special education students.

6300    State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System
 
The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). 
 
The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members'
creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an
additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place
on July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469) increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over

6300    State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System - Continued
three years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings.  The CalSTRS Board can increase the
state's contribution by 0.50 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need. 
 
The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in
quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing
power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389) increased the amount of supplemental purchase power
protection payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The CalSTRS Board is required
to set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to
CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of
an amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding
calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April
15 of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the CalSTRS
Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2) increase
employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
The Budget includes a 0.50 percent increase to the state's contribution to reflect changes in demographic and economic
assumption changes adopted by the CalSTRS Board in 2017. The assumption changes increased the system's liabilities,
resulting in an increase to the state's funding obligation.

6350    School Facilities Aid Program
 
The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities
such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs. 
 
The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility
Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Proposition 1D, approved in November 2006, provided State
General Obligation Bonds of $5.2 billion to local educational agencies for new construction and modernization projects.
Further, Proposition 1D provided $2.1 billion for Charter Schools, Career Technical Education Facilities, Overcrowding
Relief, High Performance Incentive Grants, and Joint-Use projects. The SFP also contains provisions for Critically
Overcrowded Schools and Seismic Mitigation. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, extends the existing
SFP and authorized a total of $7 billion in State General Obligation Bonds for local educational agencies school construction
projects.  These funds will be allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 billion for new construction, $3
billion for modernization, $500 million for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical education projects. 
 
3-YR EXPENDITURES AND POSITIONS 
 
 
 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
The Budget requires that projects funded under the School Facilities Program be subject to expenditure audits in the
annual K-12 Audit Guide utilizing the structure of the Education Audit Appeals Panel process.  To help facilitate
compliance with this requirement, the Budget authorizes participating local educational agencies to repay any audit
findings with local funds.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 
 
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to
ensure a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 
 
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 241,000 applications annually for
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools.  The Division serves as
the primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 
 
The Professional Services Division is responsible for:  (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas,
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations,
including the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, and (3) supporting the Commission with
analysis and development of policy.  The Division supports the Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged
with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs.  The
accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of program quality through biennial reports, program review, and
site visit activities.  Related activities include initial program approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research.  The
Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 
 
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides
legal advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team.  The Committee of
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and

6440    University of California
 
The University of California (UC) provides higher education through (1) instruction in undergraduate, graduate, and
professional degree programs and postdoctoral programs; (2) research; (3) education for professional careers; and (4)
public service. 
 
The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of
1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the
following 28 members: 7 ex officio members, 20 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-
year terms, and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents. 
 
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates the UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for
research. In addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment
primarily responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 
 
There are ten UC campuses as follows: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco,
Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses and offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional
education. The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching
hospitals in the counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and Orange. The university administers
more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs.  The university provides oversight of one United
States Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy
laboratories. 
 
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and
resource allocation. The 10 chancellors are responsible for management of individual campuses. The Regents have
delegated authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
General Fund Augmentations--An increase of $136.5 million ongoing, including a base augmentation of $131.2 million
proposed in the Governor's Budget and an increase of $5 million to support 500 additional graduate students in 2017-18. 
 
Cost Structure Commitments--A set-aside of $50 million General Fund from the UC base augmentation. The release of
this $50 million is conditioned on certification by the Director of Finance that the UC has: 1) achieved commitments made
in the agreement with the Governor related to activity-based costing and target enrollment of transfer students, 2) adopted
recommendations made by the State Auditor to the UC Board of Regents and UC Office of the President, 3) eliminated
certain benefits for UC senior managers, and 4) committed to disclose additional information as part of the annual budget
process. 
 
Office of the President--A separate item of appropriation of $348.8 million for the Office of the President, with a
corresponding reduction in UC's base funds, conditioned on the Office of the President certifying in writing to the Director
of Finance that there will be no campus assessment for support of its operations in 2017-18 and that overall campus
revenues will be greater in 2017-18 than in 2016-17. 
 
One-Time Funding--One-time funds totaling $175.6 million, including $169 million in Proposition 2 debt funds, which will
be used for unfunded retirement liabilities; $2 million General Fund for equal employment opportunity programs; $2.5
million General Fund to encourage campuses to become "hunger free campuses;" $2 million General Fund for grants to
marine mammal stranding networks; and $100,000 General Fund for grants for whale disentanglement activities.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
6445    California Institute for Regenerative Medicine
 
Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, was approved by California voters on November 2, 2004,
providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for stem cell research conducted at California universities, research
institutions, and companies. It also established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to make grants and loans
for stem cell research. The Institute's mission is to accelerate the development of stem cell therapies. 
 
The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 29-member governing board for the Institute.  The members are
public officials, appointed on the basis of their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and

The mission of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (Hastings) is to train students for the legal profession
with a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the law.  Hastings was founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton
Hastings, the first Chief Justice of the State of California. The Legislature provided for affiliation with the University of
California.   Hastings is the oldest law school and one of the largest public law schools in the United States.  The business of
the college is managed by the Board of Directors.  The Board has 11 directors: one is an heir or representative of S.C.
Hastings and the other 10 are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate.  Directors serve for 12-year terms.
Hastings is approved by the American Bar Association and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges
and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.  Hastings is a member of the Association of American
Law Schools. The Juris Doctor degree is granted by the Regents of the University of California and is signed by the
President of the University of California and the Chancellor and Dean of Hastings College of the Law. 
 
Because department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department assesses its need for new or
renovated facilities and has significant input into capital planning and the capital outlay program to support this need. For
specifics on the Hasting's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
5530 - This program provides support for the College.  Expenditures are for the following purposes: 
 
INSTRUCTION 
 
Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal
profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services. 
 
The principal objectives are to (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the
legal profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide
students with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments on legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of
professionalism for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and
responsibilities of lawyers in overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice. 
 
ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY 
 
The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to
reference and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for
classroom presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, and legal clinic assignments, and to support legal
scholarship. The law library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys. 
 
STUDENT SERVICES 
 
Student services includes admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support
Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program.  These offices provide
students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist
students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment opportunities.
These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support Program
(which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other services to
supplement regular instructional activities for certain students). 
 
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT 
 
Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public
safety, community relations, and administrative services. 
 
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT 
 
Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and
administration of maintenance and renovation activities of the college's plant. 
 
EXTRAMURAL 
 
Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college.
These include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

SUMMARY OF PROJECTS
 
 
DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS 
 
 
6610    California State University
 
The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate
instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal education programs. For undergraduate programs, each
campus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to
master's-level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctorate programs in education, nursing practice, and physical therapy.
The CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. 
 
The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16
members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, and 4 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2
student representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, 1 faculty representative, and 1 alumni representative). The Trustees
appoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide
policy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the campuses, recommends
academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. 
 
The program goals include: 
 
Providing instruction in the liberal arts and sciences, the professions, applied fields that require more than two years of
college education, and teacher education.
Providing public services to the people of California.
Providing services to students enrolled in the university.
Preparing administrative leaders for elementary and secondary schools and community colleges by awarding the
doctorate degree in education.
Preparing physical therapists by awarding the doctorate degree in physical therapy.
Preparing faculty to teach in postsecondary nursing programs by awarding the doctorate degree in nursing practice.
 
Because department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay
program to support this need. For specifics on the California State University's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure
Overview."

DETAIL OF APPROPRIATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS 
 
 
6645    CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants
 
This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their
dependents. 
 
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health
plan.  Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. 
 
The 2016-17 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula
established in Government Code section 22871 for members with five years of service.  Under this formula, the state
averages the premiums of the four largest health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes
towards retiree health benefits.  The state also contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of
each of the retiree's dependents. 
 
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution.  Premiums are
determined on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year.  The 2016 monthly
contribution maximums are $705 for a single enrollee, $1,343 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee
and two or more dependents.  The 2017 monthly contribution maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an
enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

6870    Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges
 
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to
California's 72 community college districts, which operate 114 community colleges.  The Board has 17 members appointed
by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate.  Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student
members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms. 
 
The objectives of the Board are to: 
 
Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges.
Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources.
Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis.
 
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a
related capital outlay program to support this need.  For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see
"Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Cal Grant Program Costs--An increase of $33.3 million General Fund in 2016-17 and $12.9 million General Fund in 2017-
18 to account for the following: 
 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Reimbursements--An increase of $117.7 million in federal TANF
reimbursements in 2017-18, which reduces the amount of General Fund used for program costs.
Participation Estimates--An increase of $33.3 million in 2016-17 and $71.6 million in 2017-18 to reflect an increase in
the number of new recipients in 2016-17.
Tuition Award for CSU Students--An increase of $28 million General Fund in 2017-18 to reflect the increase in
maximum award amounts that correspond with the CSU Board of Trustees' approval of a tuition increase.
Tuition Award for UC Students--An increase of $20.9 million General Fund in 2017-18 to reflect the increase in
maximum award amounts that correspond with the UC Board of Regents' approval of a tuition increase.
Tuition Award for Students at Private Institutions--An increase of $8 million General Fund in 2017-18 to maintain the
maximum Cal Grant tuition award for new students attending private nonprofit institutions and private for-profit
institutions accredited by Western Association of Schools and Colleges at $9,084 for that year.
Cal Grant C Books and Supplies Award--An increase of $1.7 million General Fund in 2017-18 to increase the Cal Grant
C books and supplies award for students attending community colleges from $547 to $1,094.
Cal Grant B Access Award--An increase of $447,000 College Access Tax Credit Fund for a supplement of $24 for any
student who receives a Cal Grant B access award.
 
Middle Class Scholarship Program--A decrease of $21 million General Fund, to reflect one-time savings, bringing the total
appropriation to $96 million General Fund in 2017-18. Approximately, 55,000 students are expected to receive a grant in
the budget year.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
5755 - FINANCIAL AID GRANTS PROGRAM 
This program provides grants and other kinds of financial aid to help undergraduate and graduate students pay for
educational expenses. The financial aid programs are described below. 
 
CAL GRANT A and B 
 
Cal Grant entitlement awards are guaranteed to students who graduate from high school and meet financial, academic, and
other general program eligibility requirements. The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are
guaranteed to certain community college students who have community college GPAs of at least 2.4 on a four-point scale. 
 
Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility
requirements. Half of these awards are offered to those applicants who did not receive an entitlement award and meet a
March 2 deadline. The remaining awards are offered to students who are enrolled at a California community college and
meet a September 2 deadline. 
 
Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 grade
point average (GPA) on a four-point scale. 
 
Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point
scale. The award is for books and living expenses for the first year. Beginning with the second year, the award also provides
funds for tuition and fees. 
 
The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU). The award at private nonprofit institutions and
private, for profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the award
at private, for profit institutions that are not WASC-accredited are determined in the budget. 
 
OTHER STUDENT AWARDS 
 
The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training. 
 
The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students of no more than 40 percent
of the UC or CSU mandatory systemwide tuition and fees. 
 
The Assumption Program of Loans for Education (APLE) issues agreements for loan assumptions to students and district
interns who are pursuing careers in teaching and credentialed teachers teaching at certain schools. A participant who
teaches a total of four years can receive up to $11,000 for outstanding student loans. APLE participants who teach in the
areas of math, science, or education specialist instruction in a school ranked in the lowest 60 percentile of the API may
receive an additional $1,000 per year in loan assumption benefits. Participants meeting this requirement who provide
teaching service in a public school ranked in the lowest 20 percentile of the API may receive an additional $1,000 per year.
The total possible loan assumption benefit is $19,000. 
 
The Graduate Assumption Program of Loans for Education (Graduate APLE) issues loan assumption agreements to
students pursuing graduate degrees at postsecondary institutions. A participant who teaches for three years at a regionally-
accredited California college or university can receive up to $6,000 toward outstanding student loans. 
 
The State Nursing Assumption Program of Loans for Education for Nursing Faculty (SNAPLE NF), allows the state to issue
agreements for loan assumptions to persons who have completed at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing or a field
related to nursing and agreed to teach at one or more regionally-accredited, eligible California colleges or universities. A
participant can receive up to $8,333 annually for three years toward outstanding student loans for a total loan assumption of
up to $25,000. 
 
The Child Development Teacher and Supervisor Grant Program provides grants to recipients who intend to teach or
supervise in the field of child care and development in a licensed children's center. Recipients attending a community college
may receive up to $1,000 annually, and recipients attending a four-year college may receive up to $2,000 annually for a total
of $6,000. 
 
The California Chafee Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 to eligible foster youth who are enrolled in college or
vocational school at least half-time. New and renewal awards are assigned based on available funding. 
 
The California National Guard Education Assistance Award Program provides funding for active members of the California
National Guard, the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia who seek a certificate, degree, or diploma. Recipients
attending the UC, CSU or a private institution may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant A award. Recipients attending a
community college may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant B award. An award used for graduate studies may not
exceed the maximum amount of a Cal Grant A award plus $500 for books and supplies. 
 
The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents (LEPD) Scholarship Program provides college grants equivalent to Cal Grant
amounts to dependents of California law enforcement officers, officers and employees of the Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation, and firefighters killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty.

The John R. Justice Program provides loan repayments to eligible recipients currently employed as California prosecutors or
public defenders who commit to continued employment in that capacity for at least three years. Recipients may receive up to
$5,000 of loan repayment disbursed annually to their lending institutions. 
 
OTHER PROGRAMS 
 
The California Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal-SOAP), through intersegmental consortia, provides financial
aid outreach and tutoring services to disadvantaged K-12 students, increases their access to postsecondary education, and
informs students about opportunities for career technical education. Cal-SOAP also assists the matriculation of community
college students to four-year institutions. 
 
Cash for College provides financial aid workshops to assist low-income students with completing the Free Application for
Federal Student Aid and the Cal Grant GPA Verification Form and understanding financial aid.
