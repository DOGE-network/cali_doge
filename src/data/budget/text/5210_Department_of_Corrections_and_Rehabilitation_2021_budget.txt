MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Adult Inmate and Parolee Population—Compared to the 2020 Budget Act projections, the adult inmate average daily 
population is projected to decrease by 25,316 in 2020-21, and decrease by 16,277 in 2021-22, to a total of 97,220 and 
106,259, respectively. This decline is primarily due to actions taken to reduce the prison population in response to the 
COVID-19 Pandemic. The average daily parolee population is projected to increase by 6,282 in 2020-21 and by 340 in 
2021-22, to a total of 54,211 and 48,269, respectively. These increases are similarly related to accelerated releases in 
response to the pandemic. When compared to the projected average daily population at the 2020 Budget Act, these 
changes result in a decrease of $184 million General Fund in 2020-21, and a decrease of $142.4 million in 2021-22. 
However, given various factors including continued staffing needs, the Budget only reflects savings of $146.3 million General 
Fund in 2020-21, and savings of $123.5 million in 2021-22. 
• Adult Medical and Pharmaceutical—Existing Medical Classification Model staffing ratios would have resulted in decreases of 
$41.7 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $31 million in 2021-22. However, to avoid reducing medical staffing at the height 
of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Budget reflects adjusted 2020-21 savings of $6 million General Fund. Additionally, the 
Budget reflects savings of $15.5 million General Fund in 2021-22 to better reflect CDCR’s true operating costs for the 
Medical Program. The out-years reflect the estimated full-year savings of $31 million General Fund. The Budget also 
includes decreases of $108.8 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $10.4 million in 2021-22 to reflect savings on 
pharmaceuticals. 
• Adult Contract Medical Program—The Budget includes decreases of $61.9 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $37.2 
million in 2021-22 to reflect a reduction of contract medical services provided to inmates outside the prison. This reduction is 
attributable to the overall reduction in the adult inmate population. These amounts are also reflected in the “Adult Inmate and 
Parolee Population” fiscal details above. 
• Mental Health Program—Compared to the 2020 Budget Act projections, the population of inmates requiring outpatient 
mental health treatment is projected to decrease by 6,245 inmates in 2020-21, and 6,409 inmates in 2021-22, for totals of 
28,269 and 28,105, respectively. Based on the current Mental Health Staffing Ratios, these changes would have resulted in

decreases of $38.4 million General Fund in 2020-21 and $45 million in 2021-22 and ongoing. However, the Budget does not 
reflect all savings in 2020-21, and instead reflects adjusted savings of $1.9 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $4.2 million 
ongoing to better align with the projected operating costs for the Mental Health program. 
• Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) Population—Compared to 2020 Budget Act projections, the 2021 Budget Act estimates an 
average daily population of 732 juveniles in 2020-21 and 613 juveniles in 2021-22, which represents a decrease of 123 
wards in 2020-21 and 242 wards in 2021-22, respectively. Accordingly, the Budget reflects savings of $2.6 million General 
Fund in 2020-21 and $10.6 million in 2021-22. Per Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 
(SB 92), DJJ ceased intake on July 1, 2021, except for limited exceptions, and is scheduled to close on June 30, 2023. 
• COVID Expenditure Offset—Although the standard population adjustments are expected to result in the General Fund 
savings outlined above, CDCR has also incurred significant costs related to COVID-19 response. CDCR currently estimates 
it incurred costs of $1 billion in 2020-21 related to COVID-19 response activities. To partially fund these expenditures, the 
Budget assumes all 2020-21 General Fund population savings ($270.8 million) will be diverted to cover a portion of CDCR’s 
2020-21 COVID expenditures. 
• COVID-19 Direct Response Expenditures—The Budget includes a total of $1.7 billion for various state departments for direct 
response costs associated with responding to and mitigating the impacts of the pandemic in 2021-22. Specifically, the 
Budget includes $408 million General Fund for CDCR for the estimated costs associated with inmate and staff testing, the 
purchase of personal protective equipment, tents and other temporary structures to support physical distancing, additional 
cleaning, and reimbursements to counties for costs related to the suspended intake of inmates from county jails. 
• Deuel Vocational Institution Closure—The Budget includes savings of $4.5 million General Fund in 2020-21, $100.9 million 
General Fund and $390,000 Inmate Welfare Fund in 2021-22, growing to savings of $126.1 million General Fund and 
$517,000 Inmate Welfare Fund beginning in 2022-23 associated with the planned September 2021 closure of Deuel 
Vocational Institution. 
• Armstrong Court Compliance—The Budget includes $13.5 million General Fund in 2020-21, $10.1 million in 2021-22, and 
$6.9 million ongoing, for the Department to comply with court-ordered video surveillance, body-cameras, staff complaint 
process changes, and increased supervisory staffing measures at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, as well as 
video surveillance on two yards at the California State Prison, Los Angeles County. 
• Armstrong Court Compliance Continuation—The Budget includes $3.7 million General Fund in 2020-21, $80.5 million in 
2021-22, and $28 million ongoing for CDCR to comply with court-ordered video surveillance, body-cameras, staff complaint 
process changes, and increased supervisory staffing measures at five institutions: California State Prison, Corcoran; 
Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison at Corcoran; California Institution for Women; Kern Valley State 
Prison; and California State Prison, Los Angeles County. 
• Statewide Process for Use of Force and Prison Rape Elimination Act Allegations—The Budget includes $7.9 million ongoing 
General Fund for CDCR to enhance the department’s ability to proactively address allegations of staff misconduct. These 
resources will allow CDCR to make improvements on both an institution and system-wide level with the overarching goal of 
increased accountability and transparency. 
• Expansion of Fixed Video Surveillance—The Budget includes $37.6 million General Fund in 2021-22 and $2.1 million 
ongoing to install and operate fixed video surveillance cameras at four institutions in 2021-22: Salinas Valley State Prison; 
California State Prison, Sacramento; California Correctional Institution; and Mule Creek State Prison. 
• Technology for Inmates Participating in Academic Programs—The Budget includes $23.3 million General Fund in 2021-22, 
declining to $18.3 million in 2024-25 and ongoing, for technology to enhance rehabilitative programming. Specifically, the 
initiative includes the purchase of approximately 37,000 laptop computers for use by academic program participants and the 
creation of a secure online academic portal that will allow students to complete educational curriculum outside of the 
classroom. 
• Valley State Prison Enhancements—The Budget includes $13.7 million General Fund in 2021-22, $3.4 million in 2022-23, 
and $3 million ongoing to make facility modifications and expand rehabilitative programming opportunities at Valley State 
Prison consistent with the Norway model. 
• Inmate Visitation Expansion to Three Days—The Budget includes $20.3 million ongoing General Fund to add a third day of 
visiting at the institutions and provide visitors with free transportation on select days throughout the year to all prisons on 
chartered buses. 
• Cost Free Remote Communication—The Budget includes $12 million one-time General Fund to provide incarcerated 
individual with access to free communication opportunities, including 60 minutes of free calling every two weeks (in addition 
to 15 minutes of free calling every two weeks already offered under CDCR’s existing communications contract) and two free 
electronic communications per day. 
• Increased Healthy Menu Options—The Budget includes $7.5 million ongoing General Fund to provide healthier meals within 
the institutions with a focus on achieving an overall healthy eating pattern, consistent with the United States Department of 
Agriculture’s Dietary Guidelines.

• Replacement of Dayroom Furniture—The Budget includes $34.8 million one-time General Fund in 2021-22 to purchase and 
install new furniture for dayrooms and common areas in non-designated programming facilities, positive programming 
facilities, and female institutions. 
• Correctional Officer Training Expansion and Job Shadowing Program—The Budget includes $21.2 million General Fund in 
2021-22, with varying annual costs decreasing to $16.1 million in 2024-25 and ongoing, to provide additional training to 
correctional officers, with a focus on providing Peace Officer Academy graduates with additional effective and realistic 
training prior to assuming their post. The proposal also includes resources to increase the Commission on Correctional 
Peace Officer Standards and Training’s staffing and resources to reorganize and expand oversight efforts. 
• Expansion of Victims Support Services—The Budget includes $1.3 million ongoing General Fund to increase the level of 
services provided to victims, survivors, and their families. 
• Increased Parole Hearing Workload—The Budget includes $3.1 million ongoing General Fund to increase the number of 
Board of Parole Hearings appointed commissioners from 17 to 21 and expand the Board’s capacity to schedule hearings 
and avoid a backlog. 
• Additional Counsel Prior to Hearing—The Budget includes $1.8 million one-time General Fund in 2021-22 to fund a pilot to 
explore the impact to hearing outcomes associated with providing an additional hour of counsel to incarcerated persons 
before they are interviewed for their Comprehensive Risk Assessment. 
• Psychiatric Inpatient Program Integration and Standardization—The Budget includes $43 million General Fund in 2021-22 
and $35.9 million ongoing to standardize staffing models across the five CDCR-operated Psychiatric Inpatient Program 
facilities and support targeted staffing increases to perform operationally critical functions. This includes resources to add 
clinicians, nurses, custody staff, and administrative positions to provide the comprehensive suite of services necessary to 
best serve PIP patients. 
• Statewide Telepsychiatry Program Supervision—The Budget includes $3.7 million ongoing General Fund to add dedicated 
supervisors within the Statewide Telepsychiatry Program to enhance program operations and provide for improved on-site

at California State Prison, Los Angeles, as part of the broad, multiyear plan to replace aging and deteriorating roofs across 
the state prison system. 
• Health Care Facility Repairs at the California Rehabilitation Center—The Budget includes $6.8 million one-time General 
Fund to replace damaged flooring, walls, wall-mounted air conditioning units, counters, and storage spaces in existing health

4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS 
The Department accepts commitments from California courts when the person to be committed meets age requirements, can 
materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there are adequate facilities available to care for the individual. 
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and 
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility 
operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, juvenile offender intake and court services, population management 
services, facility maintenance, and maintains juvenile offender master files. This program currently oversees operations for 
three facilities and one conservation camp. 
Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 
release planning for each offender. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based treatment 
programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption therapy, 
sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp programs, 
and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior and 
reduce recidivism and relapse. 
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the 
California Education Authority. Its mission is to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and 
knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release. 
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State 
Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education, 
English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for 
work experience. 
4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program is to provide medical, dental, and mental health care consistent

young adult population. 
4530 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - GENERAL SECURITY

fire prevention, watershed management, and soil conservation. Two adult institutions are scheduled for closure: Deuel 
Vocational Institution by September 30, 2021, and California Correctional Center by June 30, 2022. 
4545 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - CONTRACTED FACILITIES

facilities are the Community Correctional Facilities, Community Reentry Facilities, and Community Prisoner Mother Program. 
The final Community Correctional Facility closed on May 30, 2021. 
4550 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INSTITUTION ADMINISTRATION 
The Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Institution Administration program is responsible for the management 
and operation of 34 adult institutions, 1 leased facility, 34 conservation camps, and contracted facilities. Two adult institutions 
are scheduled for closure: Deuel Vocational Institution by September 30, 2021, and California Correctional Center by June 30,

responsible for providing facility maintenance, asset management, and construction services for CDCR's adult facilities and 
other closed properties. In addition, the Office of Correctional Safety facilitates institution and public safety via security threat 
group management, escapee apprehension, major criminal investigations, and critical incident response training. 
4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION 
The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and 
degree of successful reintegration and release to society of offenders paroled from state prison. The program is responsible for 
providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The main components 
of supervision include Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring; the Sex Offender Management Program, which 
incorporates the containment model strategy as required by statute; and general caseload supervision utilizing the California 
Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices into the Division of Adult Parole 
Operations' supervision strategies to elicit long-term behavioral change to reduce recidivism. Standard and specialized 
caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the offender's risk and current service 
needs. Based on case assessments, parolees may be placed in a higher-supervision category intended to prevent, detect, or 
interrupt behavior likely to endanger the community. Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification are regularly 
scheduled based on parolee behavior and stability in the community. 
The other integral program component is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and 
services in each prison and includes the identification of parolee needs to match them with state and local programs to support 
successful transition into local communities. 
4560 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS 
Rehabilitative Programs and Parole Operations - Adult Community Based Programs utilize a variety of rehabilitative and 
reentry assistance programs designed to promote successful reintegration of parolees while protecting public safety. These 
programs include, but are not limited to, Transitional Housing for Parolees, Day Reporting Centers, Pre-Employment and 
Transitional Work Programs, Cognitive Behavioral Treatment, Substance Use Disorder Treatment, and other Wraparound 
Services. The program includes a full continuum of transitional programs, including the Transitional Case Management 
Program and sex offender treatment for all sex offenders on parole. 
The program also provides mental health services and treatment to parolees through CDCR's Parole Outpatient Clinics. The 
objective of these services is to reduce recidivism through the stabilization and monitoring of the parolees' mental health 
issues. 
4565 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT ADMINISTRATION 
The Parole Operations - Adult Administration provides support services and administration for all programs and agents. The 
program also includes the leasing of office space for the parole units throughout the state and training for the Division of Adult 
Parole Operations. In addition, the Office of Correctional Safety investigates and apprehends fugitive parolees suspected of 
committing serious or violent crimes.

4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS 
The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and 
decisions, and to provide the required due process to inmates throughout the hearing process. 
The Board conducts parole suitability hearings for a variety of inmates sentenced to lengthy prison terms to determine if an 
inmate should be released from prison.  These hearings include individuals sentenced to life with the possibility of parole once 
they have served a certain amount of time based on the sentence; inmates sentenced to life with the possibility of parole for a 
nonviolent offense under an alternative sentencing scheme, such as the state’s Three Strikes Law, once they have served a 
certain amount of time based on their commitment offense; inmates who were under the age of 26 at the time of their offense, 
who have served a minimum of 15, 20, or 25 years of continuous incarceration, depending on the sentence, and who are 
eligible for a youth offender hearing; and inmates eligible for the Elderly Parole Program. 
The Board also conducts medical parole hearings, hearings for certain parole violators, and determines whether parolees 
should be discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for offenders with mental health disorders and sexually violent 
predators, and subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of State Hospitals for mental health treatment. In 
addition, at the Governor's request, the Board investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons, reprieves 
and commutations of sentence, including those involving the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court 
that a prisoner's sentence be recalled due to the inmate's significant health condition. 
For juvenile offenders, the Board of Juvenile Hearings is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from 
the jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Justice to the jurisdiction of the committing court, and disciplinary appeals. 
4580 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADMINISTRATION

5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and 
technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal 
justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety 
Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, 
intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is 
consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based 
strategies for managing criminal justice populations. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Strengthening Jail Oversight—The Budget includes $3.1 million ongoing General Fund to strengthen the state’s oversight of 
county jails by improving engagement by the Board, increasing the frequency of inspections, and supporting the 
development of standards more consistent with national best practices. 
• California Violence Intervention and Prevention (CalVIP) Program—The Budget includes $200 million over the next three 
years to expand the CalVIP program, which provides competitive grants to cities and community-based organizations to 
support services such as community education, diversion programs, outreach to at-risk transitional age youth, and violence 
reduction models. 
• Additional Adult Reentry Grant Resources—The Budget includes an additional $30 million one-time General fund for the 
existing Adult Reentry Grant program, which provides competitive grants to community-based organizations to support 
offenders formerly incarcerated in state prison with rental assistance and warm handoff and reentry services. 
• County Resentencing Pilot Program—The Budget includes $18 million one-time General Fund to support nine District 
Attorney and Public Defender Offices participating in a three-year pilot to evaluate a collaborative approach to exercising

5420   Prison Industry Authority 
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 
in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee, 
the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker 
of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the 
Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the 
Board. 
The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good 
work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA 
work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming. 
The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 
provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within 
enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work 
productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work 
programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services 
to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its 
operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
