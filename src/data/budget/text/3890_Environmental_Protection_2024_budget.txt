Environmental 
Protection 
California Environmental Protection Agency 
programs reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
restore and protect environmental quality, and 
protect public health. The Secretary coordinates 
the state's environmental regulatory programs and 
provides fair and consistent enforcement of 
environmental law. 
3900   State Air Resources Board 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources, fuels, consumer products, and industrial sources 
established by the Board and local air districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility to develop measures to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 
(AB 32), Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 32), and Chapter 337, Statutes of 2022 (AB 1279). The Air Resources Board 
oversees an extensive portfolio of incentives intended to reduce air pollution (including greenhouse gases), support shifts 
towards less-polluting transportation options, and advance zero emission technologies, among other purposes. The Air 
Resources Board is also responsible for developing guidance for agencies administering California Climate Investments 
programs to ensure statutory requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund are met, including maximizing benefits for 
disadvantaged communities, reporting, and quantification methods, pursuant to Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014 (SB 862), and 
serves as the account administrator for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Air Resources Board also implements the 
Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, 
Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with local air districts, the business community, scientists, 
community representatives, and other stakeholders to implement its programs. 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE 
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as 
follows: 
• Developing, implementing, and enforcing laws, regulations, and programs limiting criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and 
toxic air contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assessing the effectiveness of 
established procedures. 
• Developing testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuels and fuel additives, 
and testing equipment to ensure emission standards are met. 
• Overseeing incentive programs that provide funding to replace existing vehicles and engines, purchase new vehicles and 
engines, plan and implement improved transportation projects, otherwise upgrade or replace air pollution sources, and 
advance zero emission technologies 
3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE 
The Stationary Source Program works to reduce emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as 
follows: 
• Developing, implementing, and enforcing measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by 
the California Clean Air Act and working with local air districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient air quality 
standards.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
• Identifying substances that are toxic air contaminants and developing, implementing, and enforcing measures to control toxic 
air contaminant emissions from stationary sources. 
3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, as 
follows: 
• Enforcing laws and developing, implementing, and enforcing regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission 
reductions and other requirements of AB 32, SB 32, and AB 1279. 
• Developing, implementing, and overseeing programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, 
and other incentive programs. 
3515 - SUBVENTION 
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air districts to encourage and support effective district programs. The 
state's 35 local air districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary sources of air pollution in California. 
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM 
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing 
competitive funding to advance implementation of zero/near-zero emission warehouses and technology. The intent of the 
program is to develop state-of-the-art facilities with the lowest possible emissions. 
3530 - THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM 
The Community Air Protection Program works to reduce air pollution in California's most burdened communities by identifying 
priority communities most burdened by cumulative air pollution impacts and by developing and implementing: 
• Community emission reduction and community monitoring programs. 
• A technology clearinghouse. 
• A statewide uniform system of annual emissions reporting. 
• Community Air Grants.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3560 - WATER QUALITY 
This program advances the highest possible quality of water for the state.  Specific activities include the following: 
• Formulating, adopting, and updating water quality control plans and policies that set standards and provide guidance in 
water management decisions. 
• Monitoring water quality to determine compliance with control plans, permit terms, conditions, and water standards and 
implementing the Total Maximum Daily Load program to address pollution in the state's most seriously impaired water bodies 
by developing plans that allocate responsibility for reducing pollution. 
• Ensuring the waters of the state are not degraded by hazardous waste spills or tank leaks, or by spills or tank leaks from 
solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. 
• Requiring waste dischargers, including storm water dischargers, to prevent and abate water pollution and inspect 
dischargers to determine compliance with requirements. 
• Assisting owners and operators of underground tasks in financing the cleanup of unauthorized releases from their tanks. 
• Administering financial assistance programs, that include loan and grant funding for construction of municipal sewage 
facilities, drinking water systems, water recycling facilities, watershed protection projects, and nonpoint source pollution 
control projects. 
3565 - DRINKING WATER QUALITY 
The Drinking Water Program works to protect and improve the health of all California residents by promoting the safety of 
drinking water. This program is responsible for enforcing the state and federal Safe Drinking Water Acts, adopting drinking 
water standards, and enforcing compliance with drinking water standards. The program also establishes criteria for water 
recycling projects; supports and promotes water system security; provides support for improving technical, managerial, and 
financial capacity of public water systems; certifies laboratories that analyze environmental samples for regulatory purposes; 
and maintains a registry of certified water treatment devices. 
3570 - WATER RIGHTS 
The Water Rights Program ensures that California's water resources are put to beneficial use, while protecting prior rights, 
water quality, and the environment. Specific activities include: 
• Allocating the unappropriated waters of the state to ensure water is used in accordance with state laws. 
• Maintaining a record of title of appropriative water rights initiated and maintained since 1914, including those for stockponds, 
livestock, and small irrigation and domestic use ponds. 
• Maintaining records of water diversion and use under riparian and pre-1914 rights and groundwater extractions in four 
southern counties.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3620 - SITE MITIGATION AND RESTORATION PROGRAM 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
3960   Department of Toxic Substances Control - Continued
2024-25 STATE BUDGET — EP 51
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Site Mitigation and Restoration program implements the state's laws regarding site cleanup and the federal Superfund 
program. The program currently oversees approximately 1,290 hazardous substance release site investigations and cleanups, 
and monitors long-term operations and maintenance activities at more than 249 sites where the cleanup process is complete. 
Additionally, the program is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of approximately 1,061 land-use restrictions in 
place on properties throughout the state. 
New sites are identified through surveillance and enforcement efforts, emergency response activities, examination of other 
previously-identified potential sites, and public and private entities that voluntarily request that the Department take action to 
return local properties to productive use. These sites and projects include cleaning up federal and state Superfund properties, 
abandoned mines, other abandoned and underutilized properties known as ''brownfields,'' and both active and closed military 
installations. The program is also responsible for the Stringfellow Hazardous Waste Site, a federal Superfund site and former 
hazardous waste disposal site. 
The program works with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and other state agencies to assure response readiness 
for acts of terrorism involving the use of toxic chemicals. Additionally, the program mitigates off-highway hazardous waste spills 
and responds to hazardous waste contamination resulting from illegal drug laboratories. 
3625 - HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT 
The Hazardous Waste Management program regulates the generation, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of 
hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees permitting and compliance at 
100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste, approximately 800 registered businesses that transport hazardous 
waste, approximately 5,000 federally-regulated generators, over 70,000 state-regulated generators, and approximately 300 
facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial 
assurance resources, and supports and oversees 81 local agencies implementing the hazardous waste program elements of 
the Unified Program. 
The program monitors hazardous waste transfer, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including 
electronic manifest surveillance and monitoring of registered hazardous waste transporters; enforcement of hazardous waste 
requirement violations found through routine inspections; complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused 
enforcement initiatives. The program also enforces compliance with hazardous waste requirements related to electronic waste 
and used oil. 
3626 - HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES 
The Hazardous Waste Facilities program oversees the hazardous waste permitted facilities that are permitting for storage, 
treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste to minimize risks to public health and the environment. The program oversees the 
maintenance activities and compliance at 100 authorized facilities that manage hazardous waste and approximately 300 
facilities that are subject to corrective actions. Additionally, the program manages approximately $2.5 billion in financial 
assurance resources. 
The program monitors permitted hazardous waste storage, treatment, and disposal facilities for illegal activity, including 
electronic manifest surveillance, enforcement of hazardous waste requirement violations found through routine inspections; 
complaint intake, triage, and investigations; and other focused enforcement initiatives. 
3630 - SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS 
The Safer Consumer Products (SCP) program compels manufacturers to reduce human and environmental exposure to toxic 
chemicals that are used in consumer products. The SCP program calls for industry to develop safer consumer products by 
identifying safer alternatives that eliminate or reduce the use of hazardous chemicals which may harm people or the 
environment. The SCP also collects information on the presence of toxic chemicals in products in order to identify Priority 
Products for possible regulation; provides support and guidance to Priority Product manufacturers for the analysis of safer 
alternatives, and issues regulatory responses to proposed alternatives. The program encourages the adoption of "green 
chemistry" practices. 
3635 - STATE AS CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY 
The California Environmental Protection Agency designated the Department as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) 
in Trinity and Imperial Counties. As the CUPA, the department is responsible for implementing the six elements of the Unified 
Program: hazardous waste generator and onsite treatment activities; spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans for 
owners of aboveground petroleum storage tanks; the underground storage tank program; hazardous material release response 
plans and inventories; the California Accidental Release Prevention program; and certain Uniform Fire Code requirements 
pertaining to hazardous material management plans and inventories. 
3645 - EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES FACILITY CONTAMINATION CLEANUP PROGRAM 
The Exide Technologies Facility Contamination Cleanup Program oversees removal and remedial actions in the communities 
surrounding the former Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon, as well as closure and corrective action at the facility 
itself. Under the program, the department is responsible for testing the soil for lead contamination in properties, including

residences, schools, daycare centers, and parks within a 1.7-mile radius of the facility. The program will clean up contaminated 
soil at those properties with the highest levels of lead in soil and greatest potential for exposure. 
3650 - BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY 
The Board of Environmental Safety is a five-member board that sets fees through regulations, hears hazardous waste permit 
appeals, and provides strategic guidance to the department. The board also contains an Ombudsperson who serves as a 
resource to the public and the regulated community. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides accounting, budgeting, revenue collection, human resource and workforce management, 
regional administration and business services, contracts and procurement, and information management, and business 
services. The program also provides legal counsel, communication, environmental chemistry support, and environmental equity 
services.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3700 - Waste Reduction and Management 
The objectives of the Waste Reduction and Management Program include: 
• Overseeing that all nonhazardous solid waste is stored, collected, processed, and disposed in a safe and environmentally 
sound manner. 
• Participating in the development and maintenance of local solid waste management plans that describe how each city and 
county will reduce solid waste disposal to achieve at minimum a 50 percent diversion of waste from landfills. 
• Developing programs and policies to support the state goal that not less than 75 percent of solid waste generated be source 
reduced, recycled, or composted by the year 2020 and after. 
• Reducing organic waste disposal 75 percent by 2025 to support the state’s climate goals and rescue at least 20 percent of 
currently disposed surplus food by 2025. 
• Cleaning up solid waste disposal sites when the responsible party either cannot be identified or is unable or unwilling to pay 
for timely remediation, and where cleanup is needed to protect public health and safety, or the environment. 
• Developing and promoting waste reduction strategies through reuse, upcycling, and source reduction. 
• Promoting the use of recycled materials in California manufacturing. 
• Reducing the number of tires placed in landfills, illegally dumped, or stockpiled while promoting technologies turning waste 
tires into useful products. 
• Reducing the amount of improperly disposed used oil and promoting used oil recycling. 
• Reducing electronic waste by providing safe and convenient collection and recycling of specified electronic equipment. 
• Responding to local recovery needs following natural disasters by coordinating debris removal operations in collaboration 
with federal, state, and local agency partners.

CalRecycle administers the Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction program with a goal of achieving an 80-percent 
recycling rate for glass, aluminum, and plastic beverage containers sold in California. To achieve this goal, the Division of 
Recycling oversees the following: (1) that the California Redemption Value (CRV) is paid by beverage distributors for each 
beverage sold in California; (2) that consumers are refunded CRV for recycled beverage containers; (3) that recycling centers 
are conveniently located; (4) that grants are made to encourage recycling and development of markets for recycled materials; 
(5) that strong oversight and enforcement programs are in place to protect the integrity of the Beverage Container Recycling 
Fund; and (6) that public outreach and private partnerships are promoted.

3980   Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment 
The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment protects and enhances the health of Californians and the state's 
environment through scientific evaluations that inform, support, and guide regulatory decisions and other actions. The Office 
performs risk assessments for various regulatory programs under the California Environmental Protection Agency, as well as 
other state and local agencies, and provides these programs with scientific tools and information upon which to base risk-
management decisions. Distinct programs focus on assessing hazards and health risks, including risks to children and other 
sensitive subpopulations, from exposure to chemicals in air, drinking water, food, pesticides, consumer products, and fish and 
shellfish, as well as health and environmental impacts from climate change. The Office also evaluates community pollution 
burdens and vulnerabilities that guide the state's efforts to invest in disadvantaged communities and reduce exposures and 
risks to residents.
