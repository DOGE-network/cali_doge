vehicle emissions reduction program. To help in its clean air efforts, the Bureau also administers the Consumer Assistance 
Program (CAP). Through CAP, consumers who own a vehicle that fails a biennial inspection and who meet certain eligibility 
requirements can receive financial assistance for emissions-related repairs. Further, consumers can receive a financial 
incentive to retire their unwanted vehicle at any time and for any reason. The Bureau, in cooperation with the California Air 
Resources Board, also administers a voucher program that offers eligible consumers additional compensation toward the 
purchase of lower-emitting vehicles or transportation passes after they retire their vehicle through CAP. 
1425 - CONSUMER AFFAIRS ADMINISTRATION 
1425041 - DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION 
The Division of Investigation is vested with the statutory authority to investigate and enforce the laws administered by client 
agencies within the Department to protect the health, safety, and welfare of consumers. The Division employs sworn, armed 
peace officers to provide objective, timely, and cost-effective investigative services for its client agencies. 
1425049 - CONSUMER AND CLIENT SERVICES DIVISION 
The Consumer and Client Services Division serves to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services, 
assure proper oversight and accountability, and minimize duplication of effort. The Department centralizes several functions 
that support the administration and implementation of the goals of the regulatory boards and bureaus, such as: policy direction, 
legal assistance, review of legislation, examination validation and assistance, information technology, accounting, budgets, 
personnel, and other administrative functions. 
The Division also serves as the primary press office for the Department and is the primary developer of consumer alerts, fact 
sheets, and internet postings designed to raise awareness of consumer issues among consumers, the news media, and other 
stakeholders. Through its toll-free number, the Division operates a call center that assists consumers and licensees by 
distributing publications and applications for licensure and providing referrals to other consumer resources; responds to written 
correspondence; informs consumers about marketplace trends; and represents consumer interests at local, state, and federal 
levels. 
1435 - CEMETERY AND FUNERAL BUREAU 
The Cemetery and Funeral Bureau licenses, regulates, and investigates complaints against California funeral establishments, 
funeral directors, embalmers, apprentice embalmers, cemetery brokers, cemetery salespersons, cemetery managers, 
cremated remains disposers, crematories, crematory managers and fraternal and private cemeteries in the state. The Bureau 
also makes sure licensees comply with applicable rules and regulations concerning the proper handling of human remains and 
the management of preneed trust funds and cemetery endowment care funds. 
1441 - CALIFORNIA BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS 
The Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers ensures that only qualified persons are licensed to conduct appraisals in federally-
regulated real estate loan transactions and that all real estate appraisers licensed by the state and all appraisal management 
companies registered by the state adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and standards. 
1450 - PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARIES BUREAU 
The Professional Fiduciaries Bureau implements and enforces the Professional Fiduciaries Act by licensing and regulating 
individuals who act as professional fiduciaries in California. The Bureau protects against fraud and abuse by those who are 
charged with the care of California's most vulnerable consumers by ensuring that minimum competency standards are met by 
establishing educational and experience requirements, conducting examinations, investigating violations of professional ethics 
and law, and disciplining licensees when appropriate.

1703   California Privacy Protection Agency 
The California Privacy Protection Agency’s mission is to ensure consumers are aware of their rights, businesses are well 
informed of their obligations, and vigorously enforce the law against businesses that violate consumers’ privacy rights. On 
November 3, 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, creating the California 
Privacy Protection Agency. The Agency is vested with administrative power, authority, and jurisdiction to implement and enforce 
the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (CCPA), which is aimed at protecting Californians’ personal 
information and the promotion of public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, and rights related to the collection, 
use, sale, and disclosure of personal information, including the rights of minors.
