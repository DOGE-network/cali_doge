performance and expand access to its claimants. These resources include $11.8 million, including $6.8 million ongoing, to 
expand language access for claimants, $11.4 million for two years to fund in-person Unemployment Insurance Navigators to 
aid claimants in connecting with EDD services, and $11 million over two years to develop a direct deposit option for EDD

interest payment on the federal Unemployment Insurance loan due by September 30, 2021, and provisional language to 
augment the amount based on the actual interest payment due. 
May Revise: Benefit Adjustments – The Budget includes a $30.4 billion increase in Unemployment Insurance and School 
Employees Fund benefit authority in 2021-22 to reflect the extension of federal benefit programs in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic.   
May Revise: Administrative Adjustments – The Budget includes a $73.8 million and 762 position reduction in the 
Unemployment Insurance program in 2021-22 to align with projected workload decreases as a result of falling unemployment 
as California begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

to develop programs with the California Community Colleges, to aid in California's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
5900 - EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT RELATED SERVICES 
The objective of the Employment and Employment Related Services Program is to provide a variety of services to facilitate a 
match between employers' needs and job seekers' skills. In addition to providing an internet labor exchange system to facilitate 
this match, job seeker skills are enhanced through a variety of case-managed programs. These programs are designed to 
provide specialized services to job seekers needing extra assistance, such as CalWORKS recipients, parolees, veterans, 
youth, persons with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals. There are also EDD sponsored Experience Unlimited 
locations designed for executive, technical, and professional job seekers to assist each other in finding suitable employment. 
5915 - CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD 
The California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board is a quasi-judicial agency whose primary purpose is to conduct 
impartial hearings and issue prompt decisions to resolve disputed unemployment and disability determinations, and EDD tax 
liability assessments. The Appeals Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Governor and one 
each by the Senate Rules Committee and the Speaker of the Assembly. 
The Appeals Board reviews appeals from the decisions rendered by field judges in the state's regional offices. In addition, the 
Appeals Board may designate its decisions as precedent decisions, which constitute the foundations of the various benefit 
programs that fall within the Appeals Board's jurisdiction. 
5920 - UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM 
The Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payment program provides monetary relief to alleviate hardships on California 
workers who undergo periods of unemployment and to help stabilize the economy. The UI program provides short-term income 
replacement for individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own. 
5925 - DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM 
The Disability Insurance program minimizes the financial hardships faced by eligible workers with disabilities by providing

monetary benefits and services to those individuals. The Paid Family Leave program provides benefits to individuals who take 
time off from work to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, parent, domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent-in-
law or to bond with a new minor child, or to participate in a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to 
covered active duty of the individual’s spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent in the Armed Forces of the United States. 
5930 - TAX PROGRAM 
The EDD's Tax Program collects approximately half of California's General Fund revenues and is one of the largest tax 
collection agencies in the nation. The EDD works with employers to collect California's employment taxes and data to support 
the employment security, child support, and personal income tax programs. 
5935 - EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL 
The Employment Training Panel (ETP) is a statewide program that supports California's economy and employers, including 
small businesses, in training workers needed to compete in the global economy while providing workers with reasonable wages 
and secure employment. The ETP is a significant economic development tool for business attraction and business retention 
and works in partnership with business, labor, and government. The ETP, in conjunction with state and local partners, prioritizes 
special economic development initiatives with the objective of retaining and creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs throughout 
the state. 
5940 - WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT 
The EDD administers the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which replaced the Workforce Investment 
Act Program on July 1, 2015. The WIOA offers a comprehensive range of workforce development activities through statewide 
and local organizations. Available workforce development activities provided via America's Job Centers of CaliforniaSM in local 
communities benefit job seekers and employers, laid-off workers, youth, incumbent workers, new entrants to the workforce, 
veterans, and persons with disabilities. These activities range from self-assisted access to employment-related information to 
job skills training programs. The purpose of these activities is to promote an increase in the employment, job retention, 
earnings, and occupational skills of participants. 
5945 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS 
The National Dislocated Worker Grants Program, which was previously referred to as the National Emergency Grant Program, 
consists of federal Department of Labor funds that are used to respond to a sudden and significant dislocation of workers due 
to emergencies such as flooding, earthquakes, freezes, wildfires, or major business cutbacks. This authority allows the state to 
react immediately when the federal government makes this funding available.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6070 - PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD 
The Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) itself is composed of five members appointed to five-year terms by the 
Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. In addition to the overall responsibility for administering the various public 
sector collective bargaining laws, the Board itself acts as an appellate body to hear challenges to proposed decisions and 
dismissals of unfair practice charges that are issued by staff. Any appeal related to the representation process is also heard by 
the Board. Decisions of the Board itself may be appealed under certain circumstances to the state appellate and trial courts. 
The Board, through its actions and those of its staff, is empowered to: 
• Conduct secret ballot elections to determine whether or not employees wish to have an employee organization exclusively 
represent them in their labor relations with their employer. 
• Prevent and remedy unfair labor practices and interpret and protect the rights and responsibilities of employers, employees, 
and employee organizations under the collective bargaining laws. 
• Bring action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the Board's decisions and rulings. 
• Take such other action as the Board deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the collective bargaining laws it 
administers. 
OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL 
The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for managing the investigation and resolution of unfair practice charges and 
presiding over informal settlement conferences. The Office of the General Counsel also oversees the statutory process through 
which employees come to form a bargaining unit and select an organization to represent them in their labor relations with their 
employer. Additionally, this section defends PERB decisions in court, seeks appropriate injunctive relief, and obtains 
enforcement when a party does not comply with final Board decisions. 
DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW 
The Division of Administrative Law conducts adjudicative proceedings, which includes the presentation of evidence and 
examination of witnesses under oath. Proposed decisions are issued consisting of written findings of fact and legal conclusions.

STATE MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION SERVICE 
The State Mediation and Conciliation Service was established in 1947 to promote harmonious labor/management relations in

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6080 - SELF-INSURANCE PLANS 
This program regulates workers' compensation self-insurance plans by verifying that each self-insured employer and group of 
employers that is issued a Certificate of Consent to Self-Insure meets the statutory requirements for self-insuring, and is 
actually able to provide workers' compensation benefits to employees. The program requires that each self-insured private-
sector employer post a security deposit adequate to pay all workers' compensation benefits in the event that the employer 
defaults on its obligations. 
6090 - DIVISION OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
The Division of Workers' Compensation monitors the administration of workers' compensation claims, attempts to minimize 
disputes through outreach to employers and injured workers by providing program information and assistance, and provides 
administrative and judicial services to resolve disputes that arise in connection with claims for workers' compensation benefits. 
The Division conducts audits of workers' compensation claims administrators for compliance with the benefit delivery system 
required by the Labor Code, and authorizes payment of workers' compensation benefits to injured workers from the Uninsured 
Employers Benefit Trust Fund and the Subsequent Injuries Benefit Trust Fund. The Division promotes the practice of early and 
sustained return to work of injured employees. The Division also administers a workers' compensation information system 
designed to provide information to policymakers regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the benefit delivery system. 
Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, the Division also oversees utilization review, the Medical 
Treatment Utilization Schedule, and the prescription drug formulary to help promote the quality and timeliness of evidence-
based medical care for injured workers. Additionally, the Anti-Fraud Unit combats workers' compensation fraud in California by 
identifying providers who are subject to suspension from the workers' compensation system. 
The Workers' Compensation Appeals Board reviews petitions for reconsideration of decisions issued by the workers' 
compensation judges in the Division, participates in appellate court proceedings as necessary or when requested by the court, 
and regulates the workers' compensation adjudication process.

7350   Department of Industrial Relations - Continued
2021-22 STATE BUDGET — LWD 27
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation is responsible for monitoring the workers’ compensation 
and health and safety program. This involves conducting continuing examination of the workers' compensation system and the 
state's activities to prevent industrial injuries and occupational diseases, which includes making recommendations on how to 
improve the workers' compensation and health and safety program, as well as maintaining the occupational safety and health 
training and education program and funding an insurance loss control services coordinator. The Commission conducts 
specified surveys and evaluations required by law and issues an annual report on the state of the workers' compensation 
system, including recommendations for administrative or legislative modifications. The Commission also issues, if necessary, a 
report and recommendations on the improvement and simplification of the notices required to be provided by insurers and self-
insured employers. 
6100 - DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 
The Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) promotes and enforces the sections of the Labor Code that protect 
the health and safety of workers on the job and the safe operation of elevators, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways, 
and pressure vessels for the benefit of the general public. The coordinated efforts of Cal/OSHA, the Occupational Safety and 
Health Standards Board (Standards Board), and the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board (Appeals Board) 
accomplish these objectives. 
Cal/OSHA enforces occupational safety and health standards, investigates the causes of occupational deaths and injuries and 
helps employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. Cal/OSHA conducts inspections and issues permits for the 
operation of elevators and other conveyances, amusement rides, aerial passenger tramways and pressure vessels. The 
inspection and permitting process is the primary method used to enforce standards governing the safe operation of these 
devices. Under the administrative direction of the Office of the Director, Cal/OSHA also obtains and maintains job safety 
records, reports, and statistics; measures the effectiveness of accident and illness prevention efforts in the workplace; and 
provides accurate information pertaining to industrial relations to help inform legislative and administrative decisions made by 
state and local government. 
The Standards Board is an independent body consisting of seven members appointed by the Governor and is composed as 
follows: one member from the general public, two members from the field of management, two members from the field of labor, 
one member from the field of occupational health and one member from the field of occupational safety. It is the sole agency in 
the state empowered to adopt, amend, or repeal the occupational safety and health standards and public safety standards 
enforced by Cal/OSHA. 
The Appeals Board is an independent judicial body empowered by state law to resolve employer appeals of citations and 
accompanying monetary civil penalties issued by Cal/OSHA for occupational safety and health standards violations. It is 
comprised of three members appointed by the Governor, consisting of one member from the general public, one member from 
the field of management and one member from the field of labor. 
6105 - DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT 
The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (Labor Commissioner’s Office) interprets and enforces the sections of the Labor 
Code which relate to wages, hours of work, and conditions of employment, including anti-retaliation laws addressing employees 
engaged in protected activities, as well as implementing Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders. This work is conducted 
by providing field enforcement of laws governing public works, workers' compensation insurance, child labor, unlicensed 
contractors, rules governing meals and rest periods, the payment of overtime and minimum wage; making wage determinations 
and collecting unpaid wages; the licensing of specific industries; the payment of wages without required deductions; 
administration of the prevailing wage program and enforcement of apprenticeship related requirements relative to public works 
projects. Under the administrative direction of the Director's Office, the Labor Commissioner’s Office conducts vigorous and 
targeted enforcement in partnership with state and federal agencies against unscrupulous businesses participating in the 
"underground economy". 
6110 - DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS 
The Division of Apprenticeship Standards (DAS) matches the needs of workers with those of employers, and strengthens the 
apprenticeship alliance among industry, labor, education and government for recruiting workers and teaching the skills they and 
their employers need. The goals of DAS are to promote, develop and expand on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs, 
as well as provide consultation services to program sponsors. DAS administers the apprenticeship system in California. This 
includes initial program approval and subsequent oversight activity such as annual reviews and audits as required by the Labor 
Code to ensure that apprenticeship programs and employers are in compliance with approved standards and labor laws. The 
California Apprenticeship Council issues regulations to carry out the intent of the state apprenticeship law and sets the general 
policy under which this program operates. 
6120 - CLAIMS, WAGES, AND CONTINGENCIES 
The objectives of this program are to pay claims, wages, or contingency benefits, and to provide for payment of workers' 
compensation benefits to employees whose illegally uninsured employers have failed to make the benefit payments required 
under the Labor Code.

The Labor Code establishes special accounts in which the Labor Commissioner deposits a portion of each Farm Labor 
Contractor's, Garment Manufacturer's, and Car Wash Operator's annual license fee. Funds from these accounts are to be 
disbursed for any wages to employees which exceed the limits of a licensee's bond or time certificate.
