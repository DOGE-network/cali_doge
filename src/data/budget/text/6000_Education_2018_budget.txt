Education
Education programs provide academic services
segmented by elementary, secondary,
undergraduate and graduate programs as well as
credentialing services to ensure schools are
staffed with effective instructors. Elementary and
secondary instruction is provided to all of
California's children to prepare them for higher
education or entry into the workforce. Institutions
of higher education provide further access to the
skills necessary for career goals and participation
in a globally competitive workforce, as well as
conducting research and providing public
services.

Department of Education
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6.2 million
students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Systems Support Branch; the Teaching
and Learning Support Branch; the Performance, Planning, and Technology Branch; and the Legal and Audits Branch.
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to provide technical assistance to local school districts and to
work with the educational community to improve academic performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding
local agencies accountable for student achievement in all programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity to
enable all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and
supporting teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that
promotes effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the
administration of K-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing
broader and more effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering
systems of school, home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help
students succeed, (h) advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that
promotes good business practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of the Department.
Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure
Overview."

Education Audit Appeals Panel
The Education Audit Appeals Panel (EAAP) serves as the neutral arbiter in formal and informal administrative audit appeals by
K-12 local educational agencies, correcting errors of fact or law, and applying where appropriate a statutorily defined test of
substantial compliance for audits of K-12 local educational agencies. EAAP adopts as regulations, according to a statutory
timetable, the audit guide used in those annual audits. EAAP's mission is to set clear standards for compliance with education
funding requirements, and allow both the state and local educational agencies to avoid lengthy and expensive litigation over
disputed funding.

State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System
The state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS).
The annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members'
creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an
additional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on
July 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469) increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three
years beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers' Retirement Board can increase
the state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need.
The Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in
quarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing
power allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389) increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection
payments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers' Retirement Board is required to
set SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to
CalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an
amount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding
calendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15
of each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers'
Retirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2)
increase employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
The Budget includes $3.1 billion General Fund for state contributions to CalSTRS. This roughly $300 million year-over-year
increase is due to an unanticipated increase in payroll growth, and the Teachers’ Retirement Board’s decision to exercise its
authority to increase state contributions by 0.5 percent of teacher payroll, consistent with the funding strategy signed into law
in 2014. The Teachers' Retirement Board adopted changes in demographic and economic assumptions in 2017, which
resulted in an increase to the system's liabilities, thereby increasing the state's funding obligation.

School Facilities Aid Program
The School Facilities Aid Program provides financing to local educational agencies for K-12 school facility-related activities
such as school construction, modernization, and emergency repairs.
The Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, Chapter 407 of the Statutes of 1998 (SB 50), created the School Facility
Program (SFP) to streamline school construction funding. Proposition 1D, approved in November 2006, provided State General
Obligation Bonds of $5.2 billion to local educational agencies for new construction and modernization projects. Further,
Proposition 1D provided $2.1 billion for Charter Schools, Career Technical Education Facilities, Overcrowding Relief, High
Performance Incentive Grants, and Joint-Use projects. The SFP also contains provisions for Critically Overcrowded Schools
and Seismic Mitigation. Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, extends the existing SFP and authorized a total
of $7 billion in State General Obligation Bonds for local educational agencies school construction projects. These funds will be
allocated amongst various existing programs including $3 billion for new construction, $3 billion for modernization, $500 million
for charter schools, and $500 million for career technical education projects.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure
a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students.
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 241,000 applications annually for
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the
primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued.
The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas,
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including
the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, and (3) supporting the Commission with analysis
and development of policy. The Division supports the Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with
implementing the Commission's accreditation system to monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The
accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site
visit activities. Related activities include initial program approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is
also responsible for monitoring certificated assignments in collaboration with county offices of education.
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal
advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and
applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct
disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions.
5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES
Provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in credential
holder discipline cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process.

and Next Generation Science Standards and to develop an Administrator Performance Assessment. In addition to ensuring
that credential candidates are prepared to enter the teaching profession, candidate scores from these assessments will be
included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment.
5386 - INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS
Provides funding for competitive grants to postsecondary institutions to develop or improve four-year integrated teacher
credential programs.
5388 - CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES TEACHER CREDENTIALING GRANT PROGRAM
This program provides grants to K-12 local educational agencies to support recruitment of non-certificated school employees to
participate in a teacher preparation program and become certificated classroom teachers in California public schools.

University of California
The University of California (UC) provides higher education through (1) instruction in undergraduate, graduate, and
professional degree programs and postdoctoral programs; (2) research; (3) education for professional careers; and (4) public
service.
The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of
1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the University of California. The Board of Regents includes the
following 26 members: 7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for
12-year terms, and 1 student appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents.
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates the UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research.
In addition, the university serves students at all levels of higher education in California and is the public segment primarily
responsible for awarding the doctorate and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law.
There are ten UC campuses as follows: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco,
Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses and offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional
education. The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching
hospitals in the counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and Orange. The university administers more
than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. The university provides oversight of one United States
Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories.
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource
allocation. The 10 chancellors are responsible for management of individual campuses. The Regents have delegated authority
to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

California Institute for Regenerative Medicine
Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, was approved by California voters on November 2, 2004,
providing $3 billion in general obligation bond funding for stem cell research conducted at California universities, research
institutions, and companies. It also established the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to make grants and loans for
stem cell research. The Institute's mission is to accelerate the development of stem cell therapies.
The Independent Citizen's Oversight Committee is the 29-member governing board for the Institute. The members are public
officials, appointed on the basis of their experience earned in California's leading universities, non-profit academic and research
institutions, patient advocacy groups, and the life sciences biotechnology industry.

Hastings College of the Law
The mission of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (Hastings) is to train students for the legal profession
with a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the law. Hastings was founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton Hastings,
the first Chief Justice of the State of California. The Legislature provided for affiliation with the University of California. Hastings
is the oldest law school and one of the largest public law schools in the United States. The business of the college is managed
by the Board of Directors. The Board has 11 directors: one is an heir or representative of S.C. Hastings and the other 10 are
appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. Directors serve for 12-year terms. Hastings is approved by the
American Bar Association and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western
Association of Schools and Colleges. Hastings is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. The Juris Doctor
degree is granted by the Regents of the University of California and is signed by the President of the University of California
and the Chancellor and Dean of Hastings College of the Law.
Because Hastings' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Hastings has a capital outlay program to support this
need. For the specifics on Hastings' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
5530 - This program provides support for the College. Expenditures are for the following purposes:
INSTRUCTION
Instruction includes activities intended to prepare students for their responsibilities to the community as members of the legal
profession through theoretical instruction, practical experience, specialized training as lawyers, and support services.
The principal objectives are to (1) develop in the students the required competency in substantive law demanded by the legal
profession; (2) develop students' skills in legal and interdisciplinary research, writing, and communication; (3) provide students
with skills for independent and critical analyses and assessments on legal issues; (4) instill in students a level of
professionalism for competent participation in the legal profession; and (5) allow students to describe the roles and
responsibilities of lawyers in overcoming obstacles to legal access and in promoting social justice.
ACADEMIC SUPPORT--LAW LIBRARY
The law library includes activities intended to support the legal education curriculum by providing sufficient access to reference
and research materials to allow students and faculty members to research questions of law in preparation for classroom
presentations and assignments, moot court, trial practice, and legal clinic assignments, and to support legal scholarship. The
law library also supports the legal research needs of the larger community, including local attorneys.
STUDENT SERVICES
Student services includes admissions, records, financial aid, instructional resources, career services, the Academic Support
Program, the Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP), and the Disability Resource Program. These offices provide
students a system for application and admission to the law school and information about academic performance, and assist
students in securing financial assistance to complete the instructional program and in identifying employment opportunities.
These activities include academic advising, accommodations for students with disabilities, the Academic Support Program
(which provides instruction in analysis and writing), and the LEOP program (which provides tutorials and other services to
supplement regular instructional activities for certain students).
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT
Institutional support includes executive management and management support, human resources, fiscal services, public safety,
community relations, and administrative services.
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT
Operation and maintenance of plant includes the management of the physical environment, as well as the planning and
administration of maintenance and renovation activities of the college's plant.
EXTRAMURAL
Extramural programs include activities that are not essential to core operations but enhance the mission of the college. These
include student housing, student health services, and the parking garage.

California State University
The California State University (CSU) is comprised of 23 campuses. All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate
instruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal education programs. For undergraduate programs, each campus
requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to master's-level
graduate programs, the CSU offers doctorate programs in education, nursing practice, and physical therapy. The CSU also
offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions.
The university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16
members appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, and 4 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2
student representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, 1 faculty representative, and 1 alumni representative). The Trustees appoint
the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide policy. The
systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the campuses, recommends academic policy to
the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor.
The program goals include:
•
Providing instruction in the liberal arts and sciences, the professions, applied fields that require more than two years of
college education, and teacher education.
•
Providing public services to the people of California.
•
Providing services to students enrolled in the university.
•
Preparing administrative leaders for elementary and secondary schools and community colleges by awarding the doctorate
degree in education.
•
Preparing physical therapists by awarding the doctorate degree in physical therapy.
•
Preparing faculty to teach in postsecondary nursing programs by awarding the doctorate degree in nursing practice.
Because the California State University's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CSU has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the CSU's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

CSU Health Benefits for Retired Annuitants
This program provides funding for health benefit services for retired California State University employees and their
dependents.
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5.00 per month toward the cost of a basic health
plan. Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed.
The 2017-18 employer contribution for health premiums maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established
in Government Code section 22871 for members hired on and prior to June 30, 2017, with five years of service or for members
hired on or after July 1, 2017, with ten years of service. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four largest
health benefit plans to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also
contributes 90 percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents.
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2017 monthly contribution
maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or
more dependents. The 2018 monthly contribution maximums are $725 for a single enrollee, $1,377 for an enrollee and one
dependent, and $1,766 for an enrollee and two or more dependents.

Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to
California's 72 community college districts, which operate 114 community colleges. The Board has 17 members appointed by
the Governor, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Twelve members are appointed to six-year terms, and two student
members, two faculty members, and one classified member are appointed to two-year terms.
The objectives of the Board are to:
•
Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges.
•
Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources.
•
Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis.
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a
related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see
"Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
5755 - FINANCIAL AID GRANTS PROGRAM
This program provides grants and other kinds of financial aid to help undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at eligible
institutions pay for educational expenses. The financial aid programs are described below.
CAL GRANT PROGRAM
Cal Grant entitlement awards are guaranteed to students who graduate from high school and meet financial, academic, and
other general program eligibility requirements. The California Community College transfer entitlement awards are guaranteed
to certain community college students who have community college GPAs of at least 2.4 on a four-point scale.
Cal Grant competitive awards are available to applicants who meet financial, academic, and general program eligibility
requirements. Half of these awards are offered to those applicants who did not receive an entitlement award and meet a March
2 deadline. The remaining awards are offered to students who are enrolled at a California community college and meet a
September 2 deadline.
Cal Grant A provides funding for tuition and fees to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 3.0 grade
point average (GPA) on a four-point scale.
Cal Grant B provides funding to eligible low-income high school graduates who have at least a 2.0 GPA on a four-point scale.
The award is for books and living expenses for the first year. Beginning with the second year, the award also provides funds for
tuition and fees.
The maximum tuition award for Cal Grant A and B recipients is equal to the mandatory systemwide tuition and fees at the
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU). The award at private nonprofit institutions and private,
for profit institutions that are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the award at private,
for profit institutions that are not WASC-accredited are determined in the annual Budget Act.
The Cal Grant C Program provides funding for eligible low-income students in occupational or technical training.
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM
The Middle Class Scholarship Program provides a scholarship to certain UC and CSU students of no more than 40 percent of
the UC or CSU mandatory systemwide tuition and fees.
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS
The California Chafee Grant Program provides grants of up to $5,000 to eligible foster youth who are enrolled in college or
vocational school at least half-time. New and renewal awards are made based on available funding.
The California National Guard Education Assistance Award Program provides funding for active members of the California
National Guard, the State Military Reserve, or the Naval Militia who seek a certificate, degree, or diploma. Recipients attending
the UC, CSU or a private institution may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant A award. Recipients attending a community
college may receive up to the amount of a Cal Grant B award. An award used for graduate studies may not exceed the
maximum amount of a Cal Grant A award plus $500 for books and supplies.
The Child Development Teacher and Supervisor Grant Program provided grants to recipients who intend to teach or supervise
in the field of child care and development in a licensed children's center. Recipients attending a community college received up
to $1,000 annually, and recipients attending a four-year college received up to $2,000 annually for a total of $6,000.
The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents (LEPD) Scholarship Program provides college grants equivalent to Cal Grant
amounts to dependents of California law enforcement officers, officers and employees of the Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation, and firefighters killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty.
LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAMS
The Assumption Program of Loans for Education (APLE) issues agreements for loan assumptions to students and district
interns who are pursuing careers in teaching and credentialed teachers teaching at certain schools. A participant who teaches
a total of four years can receive up to $11,000 for outstanding student loans. APLE participants who teach in the areas of math,
science, or education specialist instruction in a school ranked in the lowest 60 percentile of the API may receive an additional
$1,000 per year in loan assumption benefits. Participants meeting this requirement who provide teaching service in a public
school ranked in the lowest 20 percentile of the API may receive an additional $1,000 per year. The total possible loan
assumption benefit is $19,000.
The State Nursing Assumption Program of Loans for Education for Nursing Faculty (SNAPLE NF), allows the state to issue
agreements for loan assumptions to persons who have completed at least a baccalaureate degree in nursing or a field related
to nursing and agreed to teach at one or more regionally-accredited, eligible California colleges or universities. A participant

can receive up to $8,333 annually for three years toward outstanding student loans for a total loan assumption of up to
$25,000.
The John R. Justice Program provides loan repayments to eligible recipients currently employed as California prosecutors or
public defenders who commit to continued employment in that capacity for at least three years. Recipients may receive up to
$5,000 of loan repayment disbursed annually to their lending institutions.
The Graduate Assumption Program of Loans for Education (Graduate APLE) issues loan assumption agreements to students
pursuing graduate degrees at postsecondary institutions. A participant who teaches for three years at a regionally-accredited
California college or university can receive up to $6,000 toward outstanding student loans.
OUTREACH PROGRAMS
The California Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal-SOAP), through intersegmental consortia, provides financial aid
outreach and tutoring services to disadvantaged K-12 students, increases their access to postsecondary education, and
informs students about opportunities for career technical education. Cal-SOAP also assists the matriculation of community
college students to four-year institutions.
Cash for College provides financial aid workshops to assist low-income students with completing the Free Application for
Federal Student Aid and the Cal Grant GPA Verification Form and understanding financial aid.
