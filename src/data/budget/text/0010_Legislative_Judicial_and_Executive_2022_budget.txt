Legislative, 
Judicial, and 
Executive 
Governmental bodies classified under the 
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive section of the 
Governor's Budget are either established as 
independent entities under the California 
Constitution, or are departments with a recognized 
need to operate outside of the administrative 
oversight and control of an agency secretary. 
Constitutionally-established bodies include the 
Legislature, Judicial Branch, Governor's Office, 
and constitutional officers. This section also 
includes such independent entities as the Office of 
the Inspector General and the California State 
Lottery Commission. 
0110   Senate 
The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. The State Senate is comprised of 40 members who are elected for 4-year terms. 
Members of the Legislature may serve a maximum of 12 years total in the Senate, the Assembly, or both, in any combination of 
terms. Members first elected before June 6, 2012, however, may generally serve a maximum of 14 years total, with no more 
than two terms in the Senate and three terms in the Assembly.

The Legislature is comprised of two houses, the Senate and the Assembly, and is responsible for enacting laws and 
establishing public policy for California. Both houses contribute to support the Legislative Analyst's Office, which provides fiscal 
and policy advice to the Legislature, and is overseen by the 16-member bipartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee. 
Because the Legislature's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Legislature has a capital outlay program to 
support this need.  For the specifics on the Legislature's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

The California State Capitol, which serves as the state’s working seat of government, began construction in 1860 and was 
completed in 1874. The Capitol remained largely unchanged until 1949, when additional space requirements drove the need for 
construction of the Capitol Annex, which attaches to the east side of the original Capitol building.  The Annex, which was 
completed in 1951, houses legislative offices, committee rooms, and the Governor’s offices. 
Government Code Section 9112(a) authorizes the Joint Rules Committee to pursue the construction of a new, restored, 
rehabilitated, renovated, or reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects.

0150   Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System 
Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional 
officers, and legislative statutory officers. 
 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf of 
its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death, 
disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions. The Legislators' 
Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. 
 
Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after November 
6, 1990. Subsequently, the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340) 
closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new members effective January 1, 2013. New constitutional officers, statutory 
officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

0250   Judicial Branch 
Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of 
the state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. 
Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially 
unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 
The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent 
funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was 
implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This 
implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The 
county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty 
revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments 
to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted

by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act 
of 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the 
counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial 
Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are 
deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of 
court facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities 
based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 
The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, 
impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United 
States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 
Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

includes $84.2 million, which is the equivalent to a 3.8 percent increase in funding for general trial court operational costs 
statewide to adjust for inflation. The remaining $100 million will be allocated by the Judicial Council to promote fiscal equity 
among the trial courts. 
• Civil Assessment Fees—The Budget reduces the civil assessment fee from a maximum of $300 to $100, deposits civil 
assessments into the General Fund instead of the Trial Court Trust Fund, and includes a total of $67 million ongoing General 
Fund to backfill the Trial Court Trust Fund for the resulting revenue loss. The Budget also includes $10 million one-time 
General Fund to backfill the trial courts for revenue losses resulting from the waiver of past civil assessment debt assessed

• Trial Court Backfill—The Budget includes $10.3 million ongoing General Fund to backfill trial courts for revenue losses from

backfill for this purpose to $60.3 million. 
• Filing Fee Waiver—The Budget includes $18 million ongoing General Fund to backfill the Trial Court Trust Fund for revenue 
losses resulting from the expansion of individuals eligible for automatic court filing fee waivers. 
• Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Court—The Budget includes $39.5 million General Fund in 
2022-23 and $37.7 million ongoing for the Judicial Branch to conduct CARE court hearings and provide resources for self-
help centers, contingent on adoption of statutory changes. 
• Dependency Counsel—The Budget includes $30 million ongoing General Fund for court-appointed counsel for children, non-
minor dependents, and parents in juvenile court dependency proceedings. This increases total funding for this purpose to 
$186.7 million annually.

million one-time General Fund for a Legal Aid for Consumer Debt Pilot program to assist consumers with debt incurred

firearm relinquishment pilot program in select courts for the safe removal of firearms from individuals prohibited from owning 
or possessing firearms. 
• Branchwide Informational Technology Modernization—The Budget includes $34.7 million General Fund in 2022-23, 
increasing to $40.3 million in 2025-26 and ongoing, for information technology initiatives to modernize the Judicial Branch 
and increase access to justice for the public. 
• Courthouse Lactation Facilities—The Budget includes $15 million one-time General Fund to expand public access to 
lactation facilities in courthouses for court users.

includes $15.3 million one-time General Fund to address egress deficiencies in the San Diego Superior Court East County 
Regional Center. Lastly, the Budget includes $11.3 million one-time General Fund to address increased project costs for an

7/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences.  For 
current year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.
8/ Total state funding for trial courts ties to actual and accrued expenditures for 2020-21 and estimated expenditures for 2021-22 for Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" included in the 2021-22 Enacted Budget.
Filled Positions 
as of 7/1/20212/
1/ Reflects the 2020-21 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the trial courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for 2020-21. Non-state 
funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc.
2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the trial courts. Excludes judges who are constitutional officers and not trial court employees.
3/ Reflects the preliminary budgets of 58 trial courts based on courts' 2021-22 Schedule 1 submissions.
4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Trial courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 in anticipation of their allocation.
5/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" (Figure 2) display for more detail. Funds are either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in 
the trial courts’ state funding in Section 1.

6/ The 2020-21 estimated rent is incorporated into the request from each program that houses employees.
5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred 
to the JBWCF. For the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.
1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Funding" (Figure 1) expenses from all funds, including the TCTF, IMF, GF, and JBWCF. The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses for those programs that have a state 
operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel). Expenditures for 2021-22 are rounded to the nearest thousand.
2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" (Figure 1) revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, 
Expenditures, and Positions" (Figure 1) display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount 
in this display and used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total" (Figure 1). 
4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of trial courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training 
(DRAFT) Program. Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel. The second line reflects the appropriated 
funds for the Federally Funded Dependency Representation Program (FFDRP).
3/ Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In addition, 23 courts in 2020-21 and 2021-22 participated in the local salary 
reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0130 - SUPREME COURT 
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system. Its decisions are binding on all other California state 
courts. The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions from the 
Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and recommendations 
for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys. The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to settle legal questions of 
statewide importance. In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are appealed directly to the 
Supreme Court. 
0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 
Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review. The six 
District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state. Cases before the 
Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 
0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 
The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary. The Council consists of 21 
voting members and 9 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair. The Judicial Council staff serve as the 
administrative arm of the Council. Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the operation of 
the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities; and 
administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired judges, 
technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 
0140023 - JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITY PROGRAM 
The Judicial Branch Facility Program administers the acquisition, planning, construction, operations, and maintenance of 
judicial branch facilities. This program is responsible for the development of long-term facilities master plans, facility and real 
estate management, renovation of existing court facilities, and new courthouse planning, design, and construction. 
0150 - STATE TRIAL COURT FUNDING 
California has 58 trial courts, one in each county. In trial courts, or superior courts, a judge and sometimes a jury hears 
witnesses' testimony and other evidence and decides cases by applying the relevant law to the facts. Trial courts have trial 
jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases. To accomplish various statutory mandates, the State Trial Court Funding Program 
supports trial courts through the following programs: 
0150010 - SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TRIAL COURTS 
This program's objective is to provide the resources necessary for the statewide trial court system to adjudicate civil and 
criminal cases. This program includes all allowable trial court administrative costs under Government Code section 77003. 
0150011 - COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNSEL 
This program provides funding for court-appointed counsel for children, non-minor dependents and parents in juvenile court 
dependency proceedings pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 317, subdivisions (b) and (c), and Government 
Code section 77003, subdivision (a)(4). 
0150019 - COMPENSATION OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES 
This program provides funding for the salaries and state benefits for Superior Court judges. 
0150028 - ASSIGNED JUDGES 
This program provides support for the salaries and related costs of retired as well as active judges who are assigned by the 
Chief Justice to positions in courts which require assistance due to judicial absences or other factors impacting the ability of a 
court to avoid case delay. 
0150037 - COURT INTERPRETERS 
This program supports the provision of qualified language interpreters in criminal, juvenile, family and civil proceedings as 
required by statute. 
0150046 - GRANTS 
This program provides funding for government grants providing public services related to the trial courts.

0150051 – CHILD SUPPORT COMMISSIONER PROGRAM (AB 1058) 
This program provides funding for Child Support Commissioners and Family Law Facilitators in every court. 
0150067 – COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE (CASA) PROGRAM 
This program provides funding for non-profits designated by the court to train and provide volunteers to advocate for children in 
foster care. 
0150083 – EQUAL ACCESS FUND 
This program provides funding for legal services programs to provide a range of services to low-income litigants. 
0150095 - EXPENSES ON BEHALF OF THE TRIAL COURT 
This program provides appropriation for statewide programs and services provided to the court or courts by the Judicial Council 
or payment for services or property of any kind contracted for the court or courts or on behalf of the courts by the Judicial 
Council, which are paid for or reimbursed by the trial courts. The appropriation also supports the implementation and 
administration of the Civil Representation Pilot Program. 
In addition to the programs mentioned above, the State Trial Court Funding Program supports a number of smaller programs 
including Access to Visitation services in family law proceedings, JusticeCorps volunteers in the courts, and Substance Abuse 
Focus Grants supporting collaborative justice courts. 
0155 - HABEAS CORPUS RESOURCE CENTER 
The Habeas Corpus Resource Center provides legal representation for indigent petitioners in death penalty habeas corpus 
proceedings before the California state courts and the federal courts. The Center also recruits and trains attorneys to expand 
the pool of private counsel qualified to accept appointments in death penalty habeas corpus proceedings, serves as a resource 
to them, and thereby helps to reduce the number of unrepresented indigents on California's death row.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Judicial Branch consists of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, trial courts, and the Judicial Council. The Supreme Court 
is located in the 103,300 square foot (sf) Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco and the 7,600 sf Ronald Reagan State Building in 
Los Angeles. The courts of appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of 
approximately 508,000 sf. The trial courts are located in 58 counties statewide, in approximately 450 facilities, and 2,100 
courtrooms of approximately 16 million sf of usable area and more than 21 million sf of space under Judicial Council 
responsibility and management. The facilities of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and trial courts encompass not only the 
public courtroom spaces but also the chambers and workspaces where judicial officers and courtroom staff prepare for 
proceedings; secure areas, including holding cells; and building support functions. Judicial Council administrative facilities, 
occupying approximately 263,000 sf, are located in San Francisco and Sacramento.

0280   Commission on Judicial Performance 
The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating complaints of 
judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the California 
Constitution. It is the only body with such authority in the state. Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and justices of 
California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to retirement or 
resignation. The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court commissioners and referees. 
In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges' applications for disability retirement. 
The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline. Judicial 
misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics. After investigation 
and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential discipline to removal 
from office. 
The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the 
Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, 
and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms. 
Commission members do not receive a salary.

0390   Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and 
Superior/Municipal courts. The California Public Employees' Retirement System administers both the Judges' Retirement 
System and the Judges' Retirement System II on behalf of its members. 
The Judges' Retirement System is closed to new members, and a second retirement system for judges was established in 
1994. All new judges elected or appointed on or after November 9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System 
II. The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final 
compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Judges' Retirement 
System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of 
contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. Judges' Retirement System II members not eligible for a defined 
benefit receive the balance of their monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment). The Judges' Retirement System II is funded 
through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment earnings. The state's contributions are adjusted 
annually to maintain actuarial soundness of the fund. 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, 
compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law. Active judges 
and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System. Additional contributions come from filing 
fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund benefit 
payments. Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources and the 
required benefit payments to retired judges. 
 
Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 
2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

0552   Office of the Inspector General 
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional 
system. OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's 
(CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, staff complaints, and the employee disciplinary process. The Inspector 
General audits and reviews the policies, practices, and procedures of CDCR. The Inspector General reviews the Governor's 
candidates for appointment to serve as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the 
state's juvenile facilities, and conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at 
each state prison. OIG receives communications from individuals alleging improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-
free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by employees of CDCR; conducts formal reviews of 
complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper management where a legally cognizable cause of action is 
present; and reviews sexual abuse incidents within correctional institutions. OIG provides critical public transparency for the 
state correctional system by publicly reporting its findings. 
In addition, OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (C-ROB) that examines CDCR's various mental 
health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for incarcerated individuals and parolees. C-ROB meets at 
least twice annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of rehabilitation and treatment programs. C-ROB 
also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on the effectiveness of

0650   Office of Planning and Research 
The Office of Planning and Research (OPR) assists the Governor and the Administration in planning, research, policy 
development, and legislative analysis. OPR formulates long-range state goals and policies to address four key areas: land use 
and planning, climate risk and resilience, sustainable economic development, and targeted long-range research needs. OPR 
acts as the state's liaison to a variety of entities including local and regional government, planning professionals, small 
business, and the Department of Defense. OPR also serves a role as convener across multiple agencies on cross-cutting 
issues in the four key areas of our work. 
The Office of Planning and Research includes three main budget programs: the State Policy Program (often referred to as 
OPR), which houses most of core planning and research functions; the California Strategic Growth Council, which coordinates 
and works collaboratively with public agencies, communities, and stakeholders to realize healthy, thriving, resilient communities 
for all and provides direct grant funding to projects demonstrating the value and feasibility of sustainable communities; and 
California Volunteers, a program aimed to increase the number and impact of Californians involved with service and 
volunteering throughout the state.

state’s most pressing challenges while lifting up all communities. From the California Climate Action Corps, the country’s first 
statewide climate corps program, to the #CaliforniansForAll service initiative launched in response to COVID-19 to establish a 
volunteer corps to support the state’s response to emergencies and disasters, California Volunteers plays an integral role in 
tackling the state’s problems. California Volunteers is led by the State’s Chief Service Officer and supported by a bipartisan 
25-member Commission and a team of experts driven by a mission to empower and mobilize all Californians to volunteer and 
serve in their communities. 
0370 - CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL 
The California Strategic Growth Council (SGC) coordinates and works collaboratively with public agencies, communities, and 
stakeholders to advance healthy, thriving, and resilient communities for all. SGC integrates State, regional, and local efforts to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions; increase the availability of affordable housing located near jobs, services, and green space; 
conserve agriculture lands; strengthen community resilience; promote public health; and advance racial equity. SGC 
administers the following grant programs: Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities; Transformative Climate 
Communities; Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation; Climate Change Research – all of which are part of the California 
Climate Investments Program, funded by proceeds from the State’s cap-and-trade auction revenues. SGC operates these 
funding programs in collaboration with interagency teams to develop program guidelines, review applications, and administer 
program funds. SGC’s Community Assistance for Climate Equity Program encompasses both the Regional Climate 
Collaboratives, which supports local capacity building and technical assistance in under-resourced communities across 
California; and the California Climate Investments Technical Assistance Program, which increases access to SGC’s own grant 
programs as well as those of many other State agencies. SGC partners with High-Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) to support 
sustainable development and conservation practices, especially in future HSR station areas. SGC’s Health and Equity Program 
advances the integration of health and equity principles in State programs and planning through the Health in All Policies Task 
Force, partnerships and collaborations, and in the implementation of SGC’s Racial Equity Action Plan. SGC's Community 
Resilience Centers Program provides grants to support communities' ability to withstand climate-related disasters and build

0690   Office of Emergency Services 
The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency 
response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's 
Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's 
homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, 
protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats. 
Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal 
agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in 
emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own 
resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the 
federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California. 
During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's 
responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal 
assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the

development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes 
prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 
Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and 
the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS 
assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of and response to criminal and terrorist activity and also facilitates 
information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission is a separate unit within the Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to 
lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well 
as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management. 
Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

Code, Title 5, Division 2, Part 1, Chapter 1, Article 6; Penal Code, Part 4, Title 6, Chapter 3. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
◦ Safeguarding the Availability and Delivery of Emergency Supplies and Commodities—The Budget includes $114.3 million 
General Fund one-time to provide warehouse space, purchase new and replace expiring personal protective equipment, 
increase commodity supply for an all-hazard event, and secure logistic support equipment. This proposal will support 
California’s ability to act quickly and help ensure appropriate resources are available across the state for all emergencies. 
◦ Nonprofit Security Grant Program—The Budget includes $50 million General Fund one-time to provide security assistance 
to nonprofit organizations at risk of hate-motivated violence, which includes members of the Asian American Pacific 
Islander, LGBTQ+, Black, and Jewish communities. Security enhancement projects include reinforced doors and gates, 
high-intensity lighting and alarms, and other security-related improvements. 
◦ Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System—The Budget includes $30 million ongoing General Fund, approximately 
$24 million in Cal OES's budget, to establish the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS) program 
to increase the real-time information and situational awareness available to the state and California’s mutual aid system 
responders and managers on all hazards events, including wildfires. FIRIS will utilize a combination of aircraft, high-
definition real time video, and data analysis dispatched 24/7 throughout the state to provide nearly instantaneous, 
accurate visual situation awareness that informs public safety and emergency management operational and tactical 
decisions. Early detection and rapid intelligence allows for the strategic and efficient allocation of resources before, 
during, and after disaster incidents, and a more effective response to reduce loss of life and property. The intelligence 
gathered will also provide data and support to the Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center, as 
established through SB 209 (Chapter 405, Statutes of 2019). 
◦ Responding to the Pandemic—The Budget includes $29.5 million General Fund one-time to continue COVID-19 testing 
efforts and provide resources to activate the state’s mutual aid system in the event of future outbreaks. 
◦ Providing Local Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Deployment Resources—The Budget includes $25 million General Fund for 
three years and five positions to provide local law enforcement support during disasters and emergencies. This funding 
will reduce local costs, accelerate response time, and provide sustainable participation of all 58 counties within the State 
Law Enforcement Mutual Aid system by minimizing funding considerations from the decision-making process. 
◦ California Earthquake Early Warning System—The Budget includes $17.1 million ongoing General Fund to support 
education and outreach, operations, and research and development of the California Earthquake Early Warning Program. 
This funding will allow the state to increase its earthquake sensor density in the rural parts of Northern California and the 
Sierra Nevada Microwave Telemetry project, and offer grants to community-based organizations to educate socially 
isolated groups and other under-served communities. Cal OES will also undertake new research in the use of Frequency 
Modulation radio frequencies, television broadcasting networks, and crowd sourcing for expanded modalities of alerting 
the public when a significant earthquake occurs. 
◦ Enhancing the Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid Fire Fleet—The Budget includes $11.2 million General Fund ($10.9 million 
ongoing) and 11 positions to enhance the California State Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System’s fire fleet. The Fire and 
Rescue Division provides federal, state, and local firefighting and rescue surge capacity. Given the severity and increased 
frequency of wildfires in California, the potential for earthquakes, floods, mud and debris flows, and hazardous materials 
incidents, these resources will enhance the capacity of the mutual aid system to meet the demands of the state’s disaster 
response entities. 
◦ 988 Suicide Hotline Implementation—The Budget includes $7.5 million General Fund ($6 million ongoing) and 10 
positions to implement a new federally mandated 988 call system to increase the ease and accessibility to provide help for 
those considering suicide or self-harm.  Those who dial 988 will be directed to one of the existing 13 Lifeline Call Centers 
across the state.  These centers already provide immediate assistance with mental distress, and the additional funding will 
ensure those needing services receive help more efficiently.  The Budget includes funding for call handling equipment so 
existing crisis hotline centers have the needed resources to process additional 988 calls and coordinate and transfer calls 
with no loss of information between the 988 and 911 systems.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
◦ Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force—The Budget includes $5 million General Fund for three years to support the 
Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program, which helps state and local law enforcement agencies develop an 
effective response to technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation and combatting underground child pornography rings. 
This investment maintains the level of state resources provided to this effort in each of the last three years.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
 
Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program 
coordinates the provision of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended 
in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-
hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National 
Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this 
program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to 
all hazards. 
0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 
Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services 
grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland 
Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency 
management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant 
management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with 
financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the 
centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion 
center. 
0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent 
earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s 
progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.  The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate, 
and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.  The 
Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support 
the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.  These activities include: (1) developing and 
reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related 
legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies, 
where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and 
supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery. 
0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 
The Public Safety Communications program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the 
state's public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The program is dedicated to the 
preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that 
keep the public connected during times of crisis. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE 
The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of Cal OES and support services such as 
accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0435 - LEGAL SERVICES 
Legal Services is organized into four elements: (1) Civil Law, (2) Criminal Law,  (3) Public Rights, and (4) Medi-Cal and Elder 
Abuse. 
Civil Law represents the State of California and its officers, agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and employees in 
civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them, prosecutes cases to vindicate state 
interests, and conducts investigations. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases 
before administrative tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the 
United States and California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of nine sections: Business Litigation; Cannabis Control; 
Correctional Law; Employment and Administrative Mandate; Government Law; Health, Education, and Welfare; Health Quality 
Enforcement; Licensing; and Tort and Condemnation. 
Criminal Law represents the People of the State of California in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts. 
Criminal Law also fulfills the Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are 
recused, conducting criminal investigations, representing the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole 
decisions and conditions of confinement in the state prisons, and defending criminal judgements in state and federal habeas 
corpus matters. Additional responsibilities include enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition 
matters, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving white-collar crimes, high-tech/computer/privacy 
crimes, financial crimes, human trafficking, environmental crimes, public corruption, and officer-involved shootings. 
Public Rights protects and preserves the public’s interests by providing legal services to state agencies, boards and 
commissions, and Constitutional Officers, and by bringing actions in the name of the Attorney General to protect the public. 
Public Rights provides specialized services in the following areas: Civil Rights Enforcement (including the Bureau of Children's 
Justice); Racial Justice; Disability Rights; Worker Rights and Fair Labor; Charitable Trusts Enforcement and Regulation 
(including the Registry of Charitable Trusts); Natural Resources Law; Corporate Fraud (including False Claims, Energy and 
Corporate Responsibility); Healthcare Rights and Access (including Tobacco Litigation and Enforcement, and Healthcare

Justice); Land Use and Conservation; Consumer Protection (including Privacy Enforcement and Sellers of Travel); and Antitrust 
Law. 
The Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse represents the People of the State of California in both criminal and civil 
matters involving Medi-Cal provider fraud, the abuse or neglect of elder and dependent adults in residential facilities, and the 
abuse and neglect of Medi-Cal recipients in non-institutional settings. The Division is a vertical prosecution unit whose 
investigations are conducted by multidisciplinary teams consisting of Special Agents, Investigative Auditors, Digital Forensic 
Specialists, Registered Nurses, and Deputy Attorneys General. Deputy Attorneys General from the Division represent the 
People of the State of California in both federal and state courts. Types of cases frequently prosecuted by the Division include 
fraud committed against the Medi-Cal program by doctors, pharmacies, clinics, dentists, medical equipment suppliers, hospice, 
home health companies, and all other Medi-Cal providers; elder or dependent adult abuse or neglect in skilled nursing facilities, 
residential care facilities for the elderly, intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled, and other specified 
residential care facilities; and the neglect or abuse of Medi-Cal recipients in non-institutional settings, when such abuse or 
neglect is connected to the provision of case. 
0440 - LAW ENFORCEMENT 
The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five areas: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services, (3) 
Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Chief. 
The Bureau of Firearms (BOF) provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms and 
ammunition laws by administering a multitude of different state-mandated firearms and ammunition-related programs. It is 
accomplished by conducting firearm and ammunition eligibility checks, conducting compliance inspections at firearm dealers, 
ammunition vendors, and manufacturers, and by providing valuable training to stakeholders statewide. BOF Special Agents 
conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the seizure of firearms, 
magazines, and ammunition. Finally, BOF Special Agents conduct investigations to monitor and prevent illegal firearm 
trafficking at permitted gun shows in accordance with state and federal laws. 
The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and scientific analysis of physical evidence, crime scene 
investigation, and scientific investigative support for officer-involved shooting investigations. Additionally BFS provides expert 
court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts. The BFS operates 10 
regional crime laboratories and two specialized laboratories, the Jan Bashinski DNA Laboratory and Statewide Toxicology 
Laboratory, which serve 46 of California’s 58 counties. The BFS also operates the California Criminalistics Institute forensic 
training facility that provides training for forensic scientists worldwide. Finally, BFS maintains the state DNA database, which 
stores and regularly searches the DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees against the DNA profiles of 
evidence from unsolved crimes. 
The Bureau of Gambling Control (BGC) regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted 
honestly and is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of 
individuals and business entities who apply for licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance 
with the Gambling Control Act and applicable regulations. BGC conducts criminal investigations in and around tribal casinos 
and California cardrooms. In addition, BGC conducts audits and reviews for tribal gaming to ensure that each tribe is in 
compliance with all aspects of the state gaming compact. 
The Bureau of Investigation (BI) is the premiere investigative bureau that is responsible for investigating and dismantling 
criminal organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses that present a significant and multi-
jurisdictional threat to California. The BI prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal enterprises involved in gangs, 
as well as cases involving major white-collar fraud, underground economy, recycle fraud, officer-involved shootings, homicides, 
foreign prosecution, human trafficking and sexual predator apprehension crimes. In addition, BI serves a principal role in 
providing leadership, coordination, and support to law enforcement through intelligence support centers and multi-agency task 
forces focusing on violent offenders, gangs, and major crimes statewide. 
The Office of the Chief (Office) provides administrative support to the investigative, regulatory, and forensic components of the 
Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies. The Office serves as the policy-making and oversight body for 
its four operational bureaus. 
0445 - CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES 
The California Justice Information Services Division provides criminal justice intelligence, information, and identification 
services to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the public. Four major functional areas carry out these primary services:

and the violent crime information system; 2) The Bureau of Criminal Information and Analysis consolidates the functions related 
to the authorization, release, and use of criminal offender record information for law enforcement investigatory and regulatory

state's financial resources, the Controller ensures the appropriate disbursement and tracking of taxpayer dollars. The Controller

The Personnel and Payroll Services Division administers the state's payroll, employment history, automated travel expense 
reimbursement system, and leave accounting processes. The Division works with the Department of Human Resources, 
California Public Employees' Retirement System, California State Teachers' Retirement System, Judicial Council, Department 
of Finance, and California State University Chancellor's Office to maximize the efficiency of the state's personnel and payroll 
functions. 
The California State Payroll System Project was initiated to modernize the statewide human resource management and 
payroll systems as part of a fully integrated solution. The system should enable the state to improve management processes 
and fulfill its payroll, reporting, and deduction processing obligations accurately and on time. 
0500400 - UNCLAIMED PROPERTY 
 
The Unclaimed Property Division administers the Unclaimed Property Law by providing one central source for owners to claim 
their property; notifying owners of their unclaimed property before it is transferred to the state; receiving unclaimed property 
from banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, and other businesses; and providing outreach and education for 
businesses holding unclaimed property. 
0500500 - DISBURSEMENTS 
The Disbursements Bureau produces and delivers all payments of the state's obligations after auditing and clearance through 
control accounts.  Examples of some of the state's payments are personal income tax refunds, payroll, vendor payments, and 
retirement payments. Disbursements also provides post-issuance services including disposition of undeliverable warrants; lost 
warrant duplication; and maintenance and production of paid warrant images. 
0500900 - DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive Office and the Administration Program provide executive direction and support services to all divisions in the 
State Controller's Office. The Information Systems Division (ISD) develops, maintains, and operates all of the department's 
mainframe, client-server, and web-based systems; and oversees the planning, procurement, use, and maintenance of 
information technology hardware and software. Within ISD, the Information Security Office evaluates security compliance, 
internal control management, and security governance.

0845   Department of Insurance 
California's publicly-elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the third largest insurance economy in the world with insurance 
companies collecting more than $371 billion in premiums annually in California while protecting consumers and ensuring the 
health and sustainability of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is "Insurance 
Protection for All Californians." CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in their 
dealings with insurance companies, and enhancing business processes to better address emerging and future challenges as 
well as improving services for insurance producers, consumers, and businesses. 
CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, CDI oversees and licenses more than 
1,400 insurance companies and more than 450,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents, brokers, adjusters, 
and bail agents and annually issues approximately 225,000 licenses (new and renewals). Additionally, CDI receives and 
investigates more than 210,000 consumer inquiries and complaints annually, performs hundreds of ongoing risk-focused 
financial surveillances of insurance companies, receives more than 23,000 suspected fraudulent claim referrals and 
investigates approximately 1,800 of those referrals, receives and reviews approximately 6,800 rate filing applications annually, 
and works in conjunction with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute fraudulent 
insurance practices.

0845   Department of Insurance - Continued
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to make sure they can provide 
the benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and 
underlying assumptions to ensure transparency and consistency in models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by 
insurance companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty 
insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the California Insurance Code 
and the California Code of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance 
sector; (6) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance 
companies to get unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases 
are actuarially justified and not excessive; (8) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses, 
satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Additionally, CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent 
insurance companies through the Conservation and Liquidation Office. 
0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders 
and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or 
underwriting by insurers and producers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent 
practices and from incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved 
and historically disadvantaged communities; and (4) assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community 
service organizations, and neighborhood associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed 
informational guides, workshops, seminars, roundtables, and town halls. 
0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 
The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for 
prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace 
officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the 
Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition, 
the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against 
perpetrators of insurance fraud. 
0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE 
This program performs tax collection, ensures the compliance of insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws 
contained in the Insurance Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and 
Fee Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the 
premium tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.

0850   California State Lottery Commission 
In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an 
initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it 
broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies to 
benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed by 
the State Senate. 
2022-23 STATE BUDGET — LJE 192
0845   Department of Insurance - Continued
LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least 34 
percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were to be 
used for administrative costs. 
In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative cost 
limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels of 
contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery 
Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily 
Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the 
University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 
In the 36 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2021, the California State Lottery has raised $39.4 billion 
for public education, including approximately $1.9 billion in FY 2020-21. 
Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2021-22 and 2022-23 cannot be made 
with certainty.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0570025 - COUNTY ASSESSMENT STANDARDS PROGRAM 
This program ensures that taxable properties are enrolled and assessed by the 58 county assessors in full conformity with the 
law. The BOE is also charged with providing consultation and services to the county assessors and their staff, establishing 
standards, providing training for assessors and assessment appeals boards, evaluating the effectiveness of each county 
assessor's administration, co-administering the welfare exemption, and administering the Legal Entity Ownership Program. 
0570050 - STATE-ASSESSED PROPERTY PROGRAM 
 
This program values and assesses inter-county pipelines and properties owned or used by railroads, regulated telephone 
companies, companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity, and private railroad car companies. Local jurisdictions use the 
established values for the levy and collection of local property taxes. In addition, the BOE collects the Private Railroad Car Tax 
that is deposited in the state General Fund. 
0570150 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM 
This program collects the excise tax imposed on the sale, distribution, or importation of alcoholic beverages in California. The 
BOE contracts with the CDTFA to administer this program. 
0570575 - INSURANCE TAX PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue to the Insurance Tax Fund. Revenue is generated from taxes assessed on insurance 
premiums, underwriting profits from ocean marine insurance, and retaliatory assessments levied on out-of-state insurers. The 
taxes collected are used to pay refunds or transferred to the General Fund. The BOE contracts with the CDTFA to administer 
this program.

human trafficking, sexual assault, stalking, elder/dependent adult abuse, their household members and minor children, and 
reproductive healthcare employees, patients, and volunteers. Participants in the Safe at Home program are provided with a 
free post office box to use as a substitute mailing address, thereby reducing or eliminating the need to use their actual

additional confidential services offered by various state and local agencies. 
0705 - ELECTIONS 
 
The Secretary of State serves as California’s chief elections officer and has broad responsibility to administer and oversee 
federal and state elections held within California. The Elections Program maintains the official statewide database of registered 
voters, tracks and certifies ballot measures, certifies candidates for placement on the ballot, and certifies official election 
results. In addition, the program oversees the certification and modernization of voting equipment and the enhancement of 
election processes. The program works to increase accessibility to voters, provides resources to educate voters on the 
electoral system, and investigates election related criminal violations as provided by the California Elections Code. 
This program includes the campaign and lobbying registration and disclosure provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974. 
Under this law, the Office registers all levels of campaign committees, and reviews for compliance with statutory requirements 
all state-level candidate and campaign recipient committees, major donors, slate mailer, political party, and independent 
expenditure committees. The program registers lobbyists (including placement agents), lobbying firms and lobbyist employers, 
reviews for compliance with statutory requirements the periodic financial disclosure reports filed by lobbying entities, and 
publishes a Lobbying Directory on the Internet. This program also supports the electronic filing requirements of the Political 
Reform Act and posts relevant registration and disclosure information to the Office's web site so the public can track where 
campaign money is raised and spent and what lobbying activity is occurring in state government. A searchable database of 
campaign and lobbying financial activity is also provided through the web site. 
0710 - ARCHIVES 
The California State Archives establishes and administers a records management program that applies efficient and 
economical management methods to the creation, utilization, maintenance, retention, preservation, and disposal of state 
records and acquires, indexes, preserves, and provides reference access to irreplaceable historic materials from the three 
branches of state government. The Archives acquires physical and electronic records with legal, administrative or evidentiary 
value, or that have historical significance. Materials are transferred to the Archives for permanent preservation. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program develops and manages overall policy. It serves as the liaison to other state agencies, the Legislature, the federal 
government, and other states' Secretaries of State. This program responds to constituent correspondence and requests from 
the public and advocates in the Legislature, administers the Secretary's role as a member of the National Association of 
Secretaries of State, in the management of task forces and advisory committees, in the implementation of new federal and 
state statutory requirements, and coordinates and disseminates information about the Office and its initiatives to the public. 
This program also monitors elections cybersecurity incidents and promotes transparency in alerting the public regarding false 
election websites and information as well as providing oversight on cybersecurity risk management. It also provides the Office 
with the necessary personnel, general administrative, budgeting, fiscal services, and information technology expertise to plan, 
develop, implement, and operate innovative and effective business and information systems solutions.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES 
The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of redemption. 
During the 2020-21 fiscal year, this Division handled 11,021 security investment transactions totaling $524.9 billion. The Pooled 
Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 9,721 of these transactions totaling $487.5 billion; time deposits 
accounted for 932 transactions totaling $26.1 billion. The remaining $11.3 billion is invested on behalf of the state's special 
funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's 
retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment 
program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the 
2020-21 fiscal year, 2,387 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $34.0 billion for the fiscal year. 
0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 
In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System 
(CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires 
the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB, 
giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits, 
and loans to the General Fund. 
The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of 
the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that 
the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer 
maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for 
the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 
The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts 
available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer

of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for 
payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities 
pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time, demand, and other 
state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by or 
pledged to the state. 
0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE 
The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes, 
revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The 
Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to 
bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 
The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse 
consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance includes monitoring 
the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and 
ensuring proper record keeping. 
0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 
services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems, 
business services, technical support, and production operations.

0959   California Debt Limit Allocation Committee 
The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt, private activity bond authority for the State 
of California. Private activity bonds may be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public benefit, 
such as the creation of affordable housing. 
The federal government limits the total amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual 
basis. The bond authority limit (debt limit) is calculated by multiplying the state population by $110 in 2021; a factor determined 
by the IRS each year. California's limit totaled over $4.3 billion in 2021.

or federal government. 
The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer (Chairperson), the Governor, or 
upon his designation, the Director of the Department of Finance, and the State Controller.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0810 - CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
The Committee administers various programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity 
bonds. Below is a summary of each program: 
Qualified Residential Rental Project Program - Tax-exempt housing revenue bonds lower the cost to develop multifamily rental 
housing, to acquire land and construct new housing, or purchase and rehabilitate existing housing. The developers produce 
affordable rental housing for low-income households by reducing rental rates charged to these individuals and families. To 
qualify, developers must elect either to reserve at least 20% of the units for households earning up to 50% AMI or reserve at 
least 40% of the units for households earning up to 60% AMI. Projects that receive an award of bond authority can apply for 
four-percent tax credits using the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee/California Tax Credit Allocation Committee Joint 
Application. 
Exempt Facility Program - Tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance any of the following facilities identified by the IRS 
as an exempt facility, including but not limited to: solid waste disposal and waste recycling facilities, mass commuting facilities, 
high-speed rail, energy and power generating facilities, and sustainable design facilities. Loan interest rate savings enable the 
project owners to charge lower customer rates, while assisting communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to 
protect and enhance the environment. 
Single-Family Housing Program - Tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates to assist first-time 
homebuyers with purchasing homes. Homebuyers may purchase single-family homes, either freestanding or detached, 
condominiums, or townhouses. Program participants must meet income limits and must purchase a home that falls within the 
program's purchase price limitations. 
Industrial Development Bond Project Program - Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds 
issued to assist manufacturing facilities finance capital expenditures. These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and 
midsize manufacturers in contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their 
communities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
The Federal Program 
Congress authorized the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax 
incentives, such as accelerated depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise 
project equity through the "sale" of tax benefits to investors. The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling is calculated annually and 
indexed for inflation. 
Two types of federal tax credits are available, generally referred to as 9-percent and 4-percent credits. These terms refer to the 
percentage of a project's "qualified basis" an investor in LIHTC projects may deduct from his or her federal income tax liability 
annually in each of ten years. A project's qualified basis is the portion of the total project cost used to calculate the amount of 
the tax credit and typically excludes non-depreciable costs such as the purchase of land. The affordable housing project 
sponsor uses or sells ten times the project's tax-credit allocation amount because investors can take the annual tax credit each 
year for a ten-year period. 
The federal per-capita tax credit ceiling for 9-percent credits is calculated annually and indexed for inflation. For 2021, each 
state has an annual housing credit ceiling of $2.81 per state resident. Additionally, each state may qualify annually for a share 
of unused credits in a national pool. 
Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may receive the 4% federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects 
must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but there 
is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. 
Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years. However, California's program generally requires 
maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure compliance. 
The State LIHTC Program 
In 1987, recognizing the high cost of housing in California, the Legislature authorized the state's program to augment the 
federal program. Housing projects receiving (or that have previously received) an allocation of federal tax credits may apply for 
an allocation of state tax credits. Projects serving farmworkers may apply for state tax credits regardless of their federal tax 
credit status.

LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The annual state credit ceiling is indexed for inflation, and for 2021, was $109.7 million. Investors take the state tax credit 
annually over a four-year period in contrast to the ten-year federal period. 
Chapter 159, Statutes of 2019, authorized the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee and the California Debt Limit 
Allocation Committee to issue an additional $500 million in state tax credits in 2020 to be paired with the 4% federal program to 
bolster new construction of low income housing. Per AB 83, this $500 million tax credit was issued in 2021 pursuant to an 
authorization in the annual Budget Act or related legislation. 
Farmworker Housing Program 
Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008, folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance Tax Credit program into the general state 
LIHTC program as a $500,000 annual set-aside in support of farmworker housing. Pursuant to Chapter 372, Statutes of 2017, 
these credits differ from other state credits in that the credit percentage for tax-exempt bond financed projects is higher and 
projects may receive state credits even if they receive a federal tax credit basis increase.

Authority 
The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908, Statutes 
of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more efficiently 
utilize and conserve scarce energy resources. Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future to protect the 
environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable energy sources, 
implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment opportunities, and 
lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels. To support these goals, the Authority provides financing and credit 
enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and facilities 
needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies. 
The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the Director 
of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, 
and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the 
Authority, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements, contributions of money, or a combination thereof, as determined and 
approved by resolution of the Authority. 
The Authority is a conduit issuer of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance local district heating or cooling facilities, and 
private activity bonds for 501(c)(3) non-profits. Past issuances total more than $212 million in bond financing for green projects 
in California. 
In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative 
source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010). The STE program expanded (Chapter 677, Statutes of 
2012) to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE awards. Chapter 768, Statutes 
of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process recycled feedstock and equipment 
that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product. In 2019, Chapter 690, Statutes of 2019, extended 
the STE program sunset date to January 1, 2026, and Chapter 672, Statutes of 2019, expanded the job creation-related criteria 
by which CAEATFA must evaluate applications. The objective of this program is to promote the creation of California-based 
manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, and energy 
consumption. 
Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and 2013 
(Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits. The Authority 
developed a loan loss reserve program for residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and a risk 
mitigation program for residential Property Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. Programs to support low-interest 
financing of Property Assessed Clean Energy efficiency projects in commercial buildings are in discussion. 
 
The Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on behalf of, and in 
collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission to develop and launch energy efficiency financing pilot programs to 
encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the residential and commercial sectors). These programs employ 
various types of credit enhancements, lower costs and expand access to capital for Californians making energy efficiency

LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM 
CPCFA’s Tax-Exempt Bond Program provides access to the tax-exempt bond market for private companies serving a public 
purpose, through the use of private activity bonds, for California businesses, for the acquisition, construction, or installation of 
qualified waste disposal, waste recovery, water furnishing, and wastewater treatment, or the acquisition and installation of new 
equipment. Small businesses may receive financial assistance towards the costs of issuance. 
Tax-exempt financing issued by CPCFA assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California 
Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, and more recently, Assembly 
Bill 1826 (Chesbro, Chapter 727, Statutes of 2014), and Senate Bill 1383 (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016). As of June 30, 
2021, bonds totaling approximately $16.7 billion have been issued by CPCFA. 
0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
CalCAP for Small Business incentivizes banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses through the 
use of a loan loss reserve account. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund specific to 
each participating financial institution. CPCFA, the financial institution, and the borrower all contribute to fund the reserve. 
CPCFA provides additional incentives for lending to businesses located in underserved communities and disaster areas. The 
reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk, supporting financial institutions when they lend to California small businesses. 
Prior to 2010, CalCAP was entirely self-funded with $38 million transferred from CPCFA’s Small Business Assistance Fund 
(SBAF), established with fees collected from large companies utilizing CPCFA's tax-exempt bond program.  In October 2010 
CalCAP received $6 million from the General Fund (Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010) to increase lending efforts. The $6 million 
appropriation was fully-expended by the end of 2018 allowing the annual recapture of contributions to become the primary 
source for the State's contributions. 
In 2011 California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168 million from U.S. Treasury's State Small 
Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). CPCFA shared the allocation with the Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank 
(IBank), now housed within the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). 
These funds enabled CPCFA to expand the availability of its CalCAP for Small Business (CalCAP SB).  In addition, CPCFA 
launched the Collateral Support Program (CSP) to further offset financial institution’s resistance to lend after the 2008 
recession. CPCFA created the CSP with a recapture provision allowing for the sustainability of the program. 
The SSBCI program ended in 2017. In an effort to sustain the program past the sunset date, CalCAP SB instituted a recapture 
provision. Funds are being recaptured annually to sustain the CalCAP SB and the CSP. 
In 2021, the federal government reauthorized the funding of SSBCI (SSBCI 2.0).  CPCFA and IBank partnered again to apply 
for SSBCI 2.0 allocation and will share the $1.181 billion allocated to California. 
Utilizing the CalCAP model, CPCFA partnered with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to assist truck and bus owners 
in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $215.9 million in Air Quality Improvement Program funds to 
incentivize lending for cleaner vehicles that comply with CARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. CPCFA also partnered with the 
California Energy Commission (CEC) to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit enhancements and rebates to 
small business borrowers and multi-unit dwellings to install electric vehicle charging stations. The CalCAP Electric Vehicle 
Charging Station (EVCS) Financing Program ended March 31, 2022. 
0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM 
The California Recycle Underutilized Sites (CALReUSE) program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized 
properties with real or perceived contamination issues. CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the 
development of contaminated properties (brownfields) to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, 
the CALReUSE Assessment Program provided forgivable loans of up to $300,000 which was later increased to $500,000 per 
brownfield site. The funds assisted with brownfield site assessment and characterization, technical assistance, and the 
development of remedial action plans. Eligible projects included sites with potential beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped 
due to lack of information about real or perceived contamination, uncertainty about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time 
frames and the regulatory process. 
Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund 
brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of the CALReUSE Program. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received 
$60 million in Proposition 1C funds and provided loans and grants up to $5 million per project for brownfield remediation that 
promoted affordable infill residential and mixed-used developments. Three projects were pre-approved to receive awards of 
more than $5 million; one grant was increased above $5 million when returned funds became available. All CALReUSE 
Program funds have been awarded. The CALReUSE Program's $60 million investment in cleanup of contaminated sites will 
result in 5,587 housing units, of which more than 47% will be affordable, in 30 California communities.

0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS 
Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and alternative 
energy production, CPCFA is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with achieving the state's 
environmental goals. CPCFA is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources including federal and state 
agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority. 
0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES 
The objective of the California Capital Access program for Americans with Disabilities (CalCAP/ADA) created by Chapter 787, 
Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and increase 
access for employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other financial institutions to make loans to very small 
businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided CPCFA an appropriation of $10 million effective January 
1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the CalCAP model incentivizing lenders to enroll qualifying 
loans.  The program also offers borrowers a rebate toward the cost of the Certified Access Specialist (CAS) Report. 
0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM 
The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program, authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a one-time 
allocation of $10 million effective January 1, 2017 to administer a credit enhancement program for qualified small businesses 
and residential property owners (including multi-unit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of 
Housing and Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other 
financial institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the 
program. 
0878 - CALIFORNIA INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION PROGRAM 
The California Investment and Innovation Program is authorized by Chapter 68, Statutes of 2022, (SB 193) and was provided a 
one-time allocation of $50 million from the General Fund into a new special fund, the California Investment and Innovation 
Fund, to support a new grant program to provide local assistance to the state’s Community Development Financial Institutions 
(CDFIs).

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM 
In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition 3 
established the second Children's Hospital Program. In 2018, Proposition 4 established a third Children’s Hospital Program. 
The purpose of the three programs is to improve the health and welfare of California's critically ill children by providing a stable 
and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for children's hospitals and, under Proposition 4, hospitals that 
provide pediatric services for children eligible for California Children’s Services. Children's Hospital Program grant funding is 
derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up to $750 million under Proposition 61, $980 million under Proposition 
3, and $1.5 billion under Proposition 4. 
0885 - HEALTH FACILITIES BONDS, LOANS, AND GRANTS 
The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health 
institutions.

2022-23 STATE BUDGET — LJE 253
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt, liability, or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power of 
the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for repayment of 
the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation or 
association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district. 
HELP II Loan Program 
The Authority administers the Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II (HELP II) to assist small and rural health facilities in 
obtaining financing for their capital needs. The HELP II Program provides two percent and three percent fixed interest rate 
loans of up to $2 million to California's nonprofit small and rural health facilities in an efficient, timely, and cost-effective manner. 
HELP II loans may be used to purchase or construct new facilities, remodel or renovate existing facilities, purchase equipment 
and/or furnishings, and refinance existing debt. 
0890 - MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANTS 
• Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 Grant Program 
Chapter 34, Statutes of 2013 (SB 82), the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 and related legislation provided 
$142.5 million in one-time General Fund, and $4 million in ongoing Mental Health Services Act funding to provide grants for 
community based mental health crisis support. 
The Act established a grant program to disburse funds to California counties or to their nonprofit or public agency designees for 
the purpose of developing mental health crisis support programs. Specifically, funds may be used to increase capacity for client 
assistance and services in crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, crisis residential treatment, rehabilitative mental health 
services, and mobile crisis support teams. The grants will support capital improvement, expansion and limited start-up costs. 
 
• Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for Children and Youth 
Chapter 30, Statutes of 2016 (SB 833), Section 20 created the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Grant Program for 
Children and Youth to increase mental health services for children and youth 21 years of age and under to develop a complete 
continuum of crisis services. Working with counties, the program funds facility acquisition, construction/renovation, equipment 
acquisition, applicable startup or expansion costs, and limited personnel funding to develop crisis residential treatment and 
crisis stabilization facilities, mobile crisis support teams, and family respite care facilities. 
 
• Community Services Infrastructure Grants 
Chapter 33, Statutes of 2016 (SB 843), Section 52 created the Community Services Infrastructure Grant Program to expand 
community alternatives to jail and prison. The program seeks to expand access to jail and prison diversion programs and 
services for those with mental health illness, substance use disorders, or who have suffered from trauma. Working with 
counties, the program funds facility acquisition, renovation, equipment acquisition, and applicable startup or expansion costs for 
facilities that provide services to this population. 
• No Place Like Home Program 
Chapter 43, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1618) established the No Place Like Home (NPLH) Program, which requires the Department 
of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to award up to $2 billion to counties for the acquisition, design, construction, 
rehabilitation, or preservation of permanent supportive housing for individuals living with a severe mental illness who are 
homeless or at risk of chronic homelessness. Chapter 322, Statutes of 2016 (AB 1628) authorized CHFFA to enter into 
contracts with HCD and further authorized CHFFA to issue up to $2 billion in taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the NPLH 
Program. Chapter 41, Statutes of 2018 (AB 1827) placed the NPLH Program on the November 2018 ballot (Proposition 2), 
where it was adopted by the voters as the No Place Like Home Act. This ratified existing law establishing the NPLH Program 
as being consistent with the Mental Health Services Act approved through Proposition 63 in 2004. It also ratified the issuance 
of up to $2 billion in previously authorized bonds.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD 
On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which 
allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings accounts. Individuals can 
make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a designated beneficiary with tax-free earnings. 
ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are used for qualified disability 
expenses. Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the Board, with the 
State Treasurer as Chair, to administer the California ABLE Program accounts on behalf of eligible individuals. 
The Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the 
purpose of creating the Program. CalABLE was officially launched in December of 2018 with the mission to meet the diverse 
needs of our customers and their families. CalABLE’s pledge is to be customer-driven, accountable, and a trusted partner in 
providing financial services. 
Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $15,000 during a taxable year, to a designated beneficiary's 
ABLE account to be used for the qualified disability expenses of that designated beneficiary.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM 
Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the issuance 
of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are available for loans to schools and 
community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new facilities, 
reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of 2006 (AB 
2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working capital needs. 
0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM 
Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities Program 
(CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities. CSFA and the 
Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the Kindergarten-University 
Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2016, for a total of $1.4 billion. The program provides a 50 
percent state subsidy for charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project costs being repaid (to the state) 
by the charter school via a 30-year loan. Recipient charter schools must provide site-based instruction, be financially sound, 
and meet other program eligibility requirements.  
0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM 
In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA received grants under the United States Department of Education’s State Charter School 
Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for facilities costs. 
Grant funds reimburse a charter school’s costs for rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for existing or new facilities 
or the costs of acquiring land and/or constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to charter schools based on 
preference points assigned based on: the percentage of low-income students; percentage of overcrowding; not-for-profit status; 
and demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding. This program is 
sunsetting in August 2022. 
0930 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM 
The Charter School Facility Grant Program provides Proposition 98 General Fund grants to assist charter schools with rent and 
lease costs. This program targets schools and communities with significant populations of economically disadvantaged 
students. Eligible charter schools are provided the lesser of $1,313 per unit of eligible average daily attendance, or 75 percent 
of annual facilities rent and lease costs. 
0935 - CHARTER SCHOOL REVOLVING LOAN FUND 
Charter 1010, Statutes of 1976 established the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in the State Treasury to provide loans of 
up to $250,000 to new charter schools to assist them in meeting the purposes of the school's approved charter. The program is 
available to any charter school that is not a conversion of an existing public school, and preference goes to schools that have 
not opened nor completed their full charter term.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0940 - BOND FINANCING 
CEFA issues tax-exempt revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning to construct educational 
facilities. Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, CEFA may be able to provide more favorable financing terms 
than might otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for the 
construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and credit or 
the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating

institution is pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the state's "private activity" 
bond ceiling as specified in federal law. 
For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "participating private college" means a nonprofit, 
private, regionally accredited, degree-granting college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on the student's 
race or ethnicity and provided that the financing does not violate constitutional provisions. 
"Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA to 
issue tax-exempt public offering or private placement loans for participating institutions, which may provide greater cost savings 
than these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing. 
0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND 
Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the 
tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of 2015,
