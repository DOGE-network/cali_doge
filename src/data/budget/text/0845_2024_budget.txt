0845   Department of Insurance 
California's elected Insurance Commissioner regulates the second largest insurance market in the world with insurance 
companies collecting more than $413 billion in premiums annually in California while protecting consumers and ensuring the 
health and sustainability of the insurance marketplace. The vision of the California Department of Insurance (CDI) is “Insurance 
Protection for All Californians.” CDI accomplishes this by enforcing insurance laws and regulations, assisting consumers in their 
dealings with insurance companies, and enhancing business processes to better address emerging and future challenges as 
well as improving services for insurance producers, consumers, and businesses. 
CDI licenses and regulates insurance companies, and individuals in California. Currently, CDI oversees and licenses more than 
1,400 insurance companies and more than 495,000 individuals and business entities as insurance agents, brokers, adjusters, 
and bail agents and annually issues approximately 288,000 licenses (new and renewals). Additionally, CDI receives and 
investigates approximately 295,000 consumer inquiries and complaints annually, performs hundreds of ongoing risk-focused 
financial surveillances and market conduct examinations of insurance companies, receives more than 20,000 suspected 
fraudulent claim referrals and investigates approximately 1,300 of those referrals, receives and reviews approximately 5,700 
rate filing applications annually, and works in conjunction with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to investigate 
and prosecute fraudulent insurance practices.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0520 - REGULATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PRODUCERS 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) oversee the financial solvency of insurance companies to make sure they can provide 
the benefits and protections promised to California policyholders; (2) review complex, principles-based reserving methods and 
underlying assumptions to ensure transparency and consistency in models; (3) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by 
insurance companies and insurance producers as defined by the Insurance Code; (4) ensure that property and casualty 
insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of the California Insurance Code 
and the California Code of Regulations; (5) assess and implement strategies to reduce climate risk impacts in the insurance 
sector; (6) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are reasonable and work with insurance 
companies to get unreasonable rates lowered; (7) review long term care insurance rates to ensure requested rate increases 
are actuarially justified and not excessive; (8) perform market conduct reviews to ensure compliance; and (9) ensure that 
applicants for insurance licenses, and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. 
Additionally, CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies through the Conservation and 
Liquidation Office. 
0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance policyholders 
and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims handling, rating, or 
underwriting by insurers and producers; (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful, or fraudulent 
practices and from incompetence relating to the sale of insurance; (3) oversee programs that benefit California's underserved 
and historically disadvantaged communities; and (4) assist wildfire survivors, local governments, small businesses, community 
service organizations, and neighborhood associations by providing access to CDI’s services through electronic and printed 
informational guides, workshops, seminars, roundtables, and town halls. 
0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 
The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for 
prosecution those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily staffed by sworn peace 
officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The program administers the 
Insurance Frauds Prevention Act (IFPA), which authorizes CDI to conduct criminal insurance fraud investigations. In addition, 
the IFPA authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in whistle-blower “qui tam” actions seeking civil penalties against 
perpetrators of insurance fraud. 
0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE 
This program performs tax collection, ensures the compliance of insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws 
contained in the Insurance Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code, and works with the California Department of Tax and 
Fee Administration and the State Controller's Office on various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the 
premium tax program. Tax collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund.
