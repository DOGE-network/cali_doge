Air Resources Board
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air
pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for
Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40
percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB
32).
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as
follows:
•
Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations limiting criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and toxic air
contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assess the effectiveness of established
procedures.
•
Develop testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuel additives, and test
equipment to ensure emission standards are met.
3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE
The Stationary Source Program works with air pollution control districts and business and scientific communities to reduce
emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as follows:
•
Develop, implement, and enforce measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by the
California Clean Air Act and work with local air pollution control districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient air
quality standards.
•
Identify substances that are toxic air contaminants and develop, implement, and enforce measures to control toxic air
contaminant emissions from stationary sources.

Air Resources Board - Continued
2018-19 STATE BUDGET — EP 3
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 40 percent
below 1990 levels by 2030, as follows:
•
Develop, implement, and enforce measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from mobile and
stationary sources, in accordance with AB 32 and SB 32.
•
Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission reductions
and other requirements of AB 32 and SB 32.
•
Develop, implement, and oversee programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, and other
incentive programs.
3515 - SUBVENTION
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air pollution control districts to encourage and support effective district
programs. The state's 35 local air pollution control districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary sources of air
pollution in California.
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing
competitive funding to advance implementation of zero/near-zero emission warehouses and technology. The intent of the
program is to develop state-of-the-art facilities with the lowest possible emissions.
3530 - THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM
The Community Air Protection Program works with air pollution control districts, community representatives, and other
stakeholders to reduce air pollution in California's most burdened communities as follows:
•
Identify priority communities most burdened by cumulative air pollution impacts.
•
Develop and implement community emission reduction and community monitoring programs.
•
Develop and implement a technology clearinghouse.
•
Develop and implement a statewide uniform system of annual emissions reporting.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
The Air Resources Board has 56 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 55 sites are occupied through
lease, permit, or license agreements. Of the non state-owned sites, 34 support air-monitoring stations and 21 sites support an
array of vehicle testing, research, planning, enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs;
some of the support sites are also equipped with an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air
Resources Board oversees to support its statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's
exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air
Resources Board leadership role related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.
