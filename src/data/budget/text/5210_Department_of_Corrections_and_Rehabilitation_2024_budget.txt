administrative oversight, and support for the overall success of all adult correctional and rehabilitation programs. The program 
consists of the Office of the Secretary; Legislative Affairs; Public and Employee Communications; Internal Affairs; Audits and 
Court Compliance; Victim and Survivor Rights and Services; Support Services; Enterprise Information Services; Labor 
Relations; Regulations and Policy; Research; Legal Affairs; Leasing and Facility Management; Appeals; and the Office of the 
Ombudsman. 
4505 - PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT 
The Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development program is responsible for planning, organizing, analyzing, and 
managing peace officer selection through the recruitment, application, testing, background investigation, and medical/
psychological screening processes. The program is also responsible for academy training and employee development for all 
departmental staff. 
4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES 
The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services 
provided by the Department of Justice to CDCR. 
4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS 
The Department previously accepted commitments from California courts when the person to be committed met age 
requirements, could materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there were adequate facilities available to care for the 
individual. 
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program was to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and 
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility 
operations. In addition, this program provided staff training, incarcerated youth intake and court services, population 
management services, facility maintenance, and maintained incarcerated youth master files. This program oversaw operations 
for three facilities and one conservation camp. 
Treatment programs began with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 
release planning for each incarcerated youth. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based 
treatment programs were recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption 
therapy, sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp 
programs, and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs were designed to promote positive social 
behavior and reduce recidivism and relapse. 
This program concluded operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on 
June 30, 2023, pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92). 
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operated as a local education agency known as the 
California Education Authority. Its mission was to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and 
knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release. 
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs were accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges and included core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students were required to meet the California Common 
Core State Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services included special 
education, English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high 
school credit for work experience. 
This program is concluded operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on 
June 30, 2023, pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92). 
4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program was to provide medical, dental, and mental health care consistent 
with adopted standards for the quality and scope of services within a custodial environment. The program strove to achieve this

responsible for providing direct supervision and Global Positioning System (GPS) surveillance of the state’s parolee population. 
It is also responsible for the location and apprehension of parolees who have absconded or when certain case factors exist. 
The Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies utilize the California Parole Supervision and Reintegration 
Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices to elicit long-term behavioral changes to reduce recidivism. Standard and 
specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the incarcerated person's risk 
factors and current mental health needs. Case Supervision level, reassessment, and reclassification are regularly scheduled 
based on parolee behavior and stability in the community. Other components of supervision include the Sex Offender 
Management Program, which incorporates the containment model strategy and GPS monitoring for all sex offenders as 
required by statute. 
Another integral aspect of this program is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and 
services in each prison and includes the identification of parolee needs to match them with state and local programs to support 
successful transition from incarceration to the community. 
4560 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS 
Rehabilitative Programs and Parole Operations - Adult Community Based Programs utilize a variety of rehabilitative and 
reentry assistance programs designed to promote successful reintegration of parolees into their communities and reduce

4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS 
The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and 
decisions, and to provide due process to incarcerated persons throughout the hearing process. 
The Board conducts parole suitability hearings for incarcerated persons sentenced to lengthy prison terms to determine 
eligibility for release from prison. These hearings include individuals sentenced to life with the possibility of parole once they 
have served a certain amount of time based on the sentence; incarcerated persons sentenced to life with the possibility of 
parole for a nonviolent offense under an alternative sentencing scheme, such as the state’s Three Strikes Law, once they have 
served a certain amount of time based on their commitment offense; incarcerated persons who were under the age of 26 at the 
time of their offense, and have served a minimum of 15, 20, or 25 years of continuous incarceration, depending on the 
sentence, or under the age of 18 if sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, and are eligible for a Youth Offender 
Parole hearing; and incarcerated persons eligible for the Elderly Parole Program. 
The Board conducts medical parole hearings and hearings for certain parole violators.  Additionally, the Board administratively 
reviews certain determinately-sentenced persons who are convicted of nonviolent offenses for possible release, approves 
transfers of foreign citizens who are incarcerated in California to their native countries where they are to serve the remainder of 
their sentence, and determines whether certain parolees should be discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for 
offenders with mental health disorders and sexually violent predators, and subsequent hearing referrals are made to the 
Department of State Hospitals for mental health treatment. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board investigates 
applications and forwards recommendations for pardons, reprieves and commutations of sentence, and extends such services 
to those involving the death penalty. The Board also has the discretion to recommend to the court that an incarcerated person’s 
sentence be recalled and that they be resentenced.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
As one of the largest departments in state government, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) operates 32 
state-owned institutions and 35 firefighting and conservation camps. CDCR's infrastructure includes more than 41 million 
square feet of state-owned building space on more than 21,000 acres of land (33 square miles) statewide. 
CDCR and the Board of State and Community Corrections jointly administer several programs to partially finance the design 
and construction of county correctional facilities. The programs consist of Adult Local Criminal Justice and Local Youth 
Offender Rehabilitation facilities. Legislation is comprised of the 2007 Senate Bill 81 (Youth), the 2007 Assembly Bill 900 
(Adult), the 2012 Senate Bill 1022 (Adult), the 2014 Senate Bill 863 (Adult), and the 2016 Senate Bill 844 (Adult). 
Approximately $294 million has been awarded to 19 counties to build or remodel Youth Offender facilities and approximately 
$2.158 billion has been awarded to 54 counties to build or remodel Adult Local Criminal facilities. CDCR oversees 42 of these 
projects totaling approximately $1.617 billion authorized from Assembly Bill 900, Senate Bill 81, and Senate Bill 1022.

5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and technical 
assistance necessary to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships within California's adult and juvenile criminal 
justice systems, and to promote legal and safe conditions for youth, the incarcerated, and staff in local detention facilities. This 
mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, intervention, suppression, 
and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is consistent with the integrated 
statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based strategies for managing 
criminal justice populations. The Board seeks to ensure that its efforts are systematically informed by experts and stakeholders 
with subject matter expertise. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation jointly 
administer several programs to partially finance the design and construction of county correctional facilities. The programs 
consist of Adult Local Criminal Justice and Local Youth Offender Rehabilitation facilities. Legislation is comprised of the 2007 
Senate Bill 81 (Youth), the 2007 Assembly Bill 900 (Adult), the 2012 Senate Bill 1022 (Adult), the 2014 Senate Bill 863 (Adult), 
and the 2016 Senate Bill 844 (Adult). Approximately $294 million has been awarded to 19 counties to build or remodel Youth 
Offender facilities and approximately $2.158 billion has been awarded to 54 counties to build or remodel Adult Local Criminal 
facilities. BSCC oversees 29 of these projects totaling approximately $938 million authorized from Senate Bill 1022, Senate Bill 
863, and Senate Bill 844.

5420   Prison Industry Authority 
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 
in a manner similar to private industry. CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or their designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or their designee, the 
Secretary of the California State Transportation Agency or their designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker of the 
Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the Governor 
representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of CDCR or their designee serves as chair of the Board. 
CALPIA supports CDCR’s public safety mission by providing job training programs to incarcerated individuals. These programs 
are to help the incarcerated individuals develop job skills, establish good work habits, and obtain basic education and job 
support so when they return to their communities they can gain meaningful employment and be productive and successful. 
CALPIA's number one goal is rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. 
CALPIA has three statutory objectives: (1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 
provide work opportunities for incarcerated individuals under the jurisdiction of CDCR; (2) create and maintain working 
conditions within enterprises similar to those that prevail in private industry to assure incarcerated individuals assigned therein 
the opportunity to work productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 
(3) operate work programs for incarcerated individuals that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from 
the sale of products and services to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by CDCR. 
CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
