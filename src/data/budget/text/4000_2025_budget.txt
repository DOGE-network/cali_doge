PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3831 - HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY 
The Hospital Fair Billing Program receives and investigates consumer complaints regarding hospital billing and enforces the 
hospital fair pricing policies. The Office of Health Care Affordability (OHCA) has three primary responsibilities: managing cost 
growth targets, monitoring system performance, and assessing market consolidation. OHCA will collect, analyze, and publicly 
report data on total health care expenditures, and enforce cost growth targets set by a new Health Care Affordability Board. To 
ensure a balanced approach to managing costs, OHCA will monitor system performance by measuring quality, equity, adoption 
of alternative payment models, investment in primary care and behavioral health, and workforce stability. Through cost and 
market impact reviews, OHCA will analyze transactions that are likely to significantly impact on market competition, the state’s 
ability to meet cost targets, or affordability for consumers and purchasers. Based on results of the review, OHCA will then

3840 - FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT 
The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and 
construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of 
providing sustained services to the public. 
3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE 
The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and 
nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors 
the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating 
access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California. 
The Distressed Hospital Loan Program requires HCAI and the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (CHFFA) to 
collaboratively administer the Distressed Hospital Loan Program to offer interest-free, working capital loans to non-profit and 
publicly-operated financially distressed hospitals, including hospitals that belong to integrated health care systems with no more 
than two separately licensed hospitals in California that are facing a risk of closure, while they implement turnaround strategies 
to regain financial viability.  HCAI contracts with CHFFA through an Inter-Agency Agreement to administer the loan program. 
The founding legislation also includes provisions requiring hospitals to submit quarterly financial data to HCAI, for use in 
monitoring the financial health of hospitals throughout the state. 
3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 
The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from 
approximately 9,500 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and treatment 
data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory 
surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. The program also collects data on prescription drug wholesale costs, hospital 
supplier diversity spending, and hospital quality and equity measures. This information is used by health care policymakers, 
health care providers, health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the 
media. 
3860 - ADMINISTRATION 
Administration provides overall management, planning, policy development, legal, legislative, information technology support 
and administrative services to HCAI. 
3865 - HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATA PROGRAM 
The Health Care Payments Database (HPD) is California’s All Payer Claims Database or APCD. The HPD is a research 
database comprised of healthcare administrative data: claims and encounters generated by transactions among payers and 
providers on behalf of insured individuals. The information from the HPD is intended to support greater health care cost

transparency and will be used to inform policy decisions regarding the provision of quality health care, and to reduce health 
care costs and disparities. It is also intended for the information to be used to develop innovative approaches, services, and 
programs that may have the potential to deliver health care that is both cost effective and responsive to the needs of all 
Californians.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3890 - NUTRITION 
The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60 
years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the 
isolation of the elderly and providing a link to social and supportive services such as transportation, information and assistance, 
employment, and education. 
3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 
The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized 
training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also 
promotes transition to unsubsidized employment. 
3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 
This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers, 
grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance, 
legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term 
Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support 
necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care 
services appropriate to their needs.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 
Community-based programs and projects includes the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP 
provides personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary 
local source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health 
plans. 
Additionally, the Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC) program is a local, coordinated network of long-term 
services and supports (LTSS) providers which enable Californians to have the information and navigation support to make 
informed decisions and age with dignity. ADRC is an essential program in California’s aging and disability No Wrong Door 
system and a key component of the Governor’s Master Plan for Aging. 
3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services 
(CBAS) program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social 
care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who 
otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to 
adults 18 years of age or over who are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health 
conditions and/or disabilities. The Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. 
3915 - POLICY AND PLANNING 
This program, within the Division of Policy, Research and Equity (DPRE), focuses on advancing California’s Master Plan for 
Aging (MPA) in collaboration with state partners and stakeholders. Through policy development, research, and stakeholder 
engagement, DPRE focuses on imbedding equity within all MPA policies, programs and initiatives that impact older adults, 
people with disabilities and caregivers.

† Savings resulting from SEC. 4.05 and/or SEC. 4.12 of the 2024 Budget Act are currently being recorded as an unallocated 
statewide set-aside. As a result, this department’s budgetary displays may reflect overstated expenditures and may also 
potentially reflect negative fund balances in particular programs and funds. Fiscal year 2023-24 budget display reflects the best 
available information for use in decision-making for this department and/or these fund(s). Additional review and reconciliation of 
2023-24 ending fund balances will occur in the spring to evaluate if a budget adjustment is required.

† Savings resulting from SEC. 4.05 and/or SEC. 4.12 of the 2024 Budget Act are currently being recorded as an unallocated 
statewide set-aside. As a result, this department’s budgetary displays may reflect overstated expenditures and may also 
potentially reflect negative fund balances in particular programs and funds. Fiscal year 2023-24 budget display reflects the best 
available information for use in decision-making for this department and/or these fund(s). Additional review and reconciliation of 
2023-24 ending fund balances will occur in the spring to evaluate if a budget adjustment is required.

† Savings resulting from SEC. 4.05 and/or SEC. 4.12 of the 2024 Budget Act are currently being recorded as an unallocated 
statewide set-aside. As a result, this department’s budgetary displays may reflect overstated expenditures and may also 
potentially reflect negative fund balances in particular programs and funds. Fiscal year 2023-24 budget display reflects the best 
available information for use in decision-making for this department and/or these fund(s). Additional review and reconciliation of 
2023-24 ending fund balances will occur in the spring to evaluate if a budget adjustment is required.

† Savings resulting from SEC. 4.05 and/or SEC. 4.12 of the 2024 Budget Act are currently being recorded as an unallocated 
statewide set-aside. As a result, this department’s budgetary displays may reflect overstated expenditures and may also 
potentially reflect negative fund balances in particular programs and funds. Fiscal year 2023-24 budget display reflects the best 
available information for use in decision-making for this department and/or these fund(s). Additional review and reconciliation of 
2023-24 ending fund balances will occur in the spring to evaluate if a budget adjustment is required.

† Savings resulting from SEC. 4.05 and/or SEC. 4.12 of the 2024 Budget Act are currently being recorded as an unallocated 
statewide set-aside. As a result, this department’s budgetary displays may reflect overstated expenditures and may also 
potentially reflect negative fund balances in particular programs and funds. Fiscal year 2023-24 budget display reflects the best 
available information for use in decision-making for this department and/or these fund(s). Additional review and reconciliation of 
2023-24 ending fund balances will occur in the spring to evaluate if a budget adjustment is required.

4300   Department of Developmental Services 
The Department of Developmental Services (Department) is responsible for overseeing the coordination and delivery of 
services and supports that enable people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to achieve their life goals. The 
Department sets broad policy and provides leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities and 
standards for the developmental services programs it operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to 
remediate problems that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based 
community agencies known as regional centers, as well as through state-operated programs. 
Because the Department’s state-operated programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

4440   Department of State Hospitals 
The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is 
to provide evaluation and treatment for individuals with complex behavioral health needs in a safe, equitable, and responsible 
manner, by leading innovation and excellence across a continuum of care. The Department is responsible for the daily care and 
provision of mental health treatment of its patients. The Department oversees five state hospitals located in Atascadero, 
Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and Patton, with administrative offices in Sacramento and employs nearly 13,000 
staff. In addition to the state hospital treatment,  the Department provides services in contracted jail-based competency 
treatment (JBCT), community-based restoration (CBR), community inpatient facilities and pre-trial felony mental health 
diversion programs, and the conditional release program (CONREP). 
Because the Department programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

Department provides training standards, model programs, cultural competency, program development, and a comprehensive 
training plan to all protective services staff. 
4420 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM 
The Conditional Release Program is the statewide system of community-based services for specified forensic patients. 
Mandated as a state responsibility by the Governor's Mental Health Initiative of 1984, the program began operations on 
January 1, 1986. 
4420010 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM 
The Conditional Release Program General/Non-Sexually Violent Predators is comprised of NGI, OMD, and IST. Individuals 
suitable for this program may be recommended by the state hospital medical director to the courts for outpatient treatment. 
Currently, DSH contracts with county-operated and private organizations serving all 58 counties in the state with non-SVP 
commitments. 
4420020 - CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM - SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS 
The Conditional Release Program-Sexually Violent Predators was added to the Conditional Release Program effective January 
1, 1996 per Welfare and Institutions Code 6604. Prior to the conditional release of the first SVP in 2003, conditional release 
providers did not have treatment services that would allow them to accept sexually violent predators as patients, requiring the 
Department of State Hospitals to enter into an annual contract with a single private provider serving 58 counties. Current 
statute requires SVPs be conditionally released to their county of domicile and sufficient funding be available to provide 
treatment and supervision services when an SVP is conditionally released into the community by court order. 
4430 - CONTRACTED PATIENT SERVICES 
The Department of State Hospitals contracts with local entities to provide mental health services to some of its patients outside

treatment to these individuals in county jails, restoring them to competency, and allowing for participation in court proceedings. 
4430060 - The Community Based Incompetent to Stand Trial programs are partnerships with various counties to treat felony 
IST in a community mental health treatment setting. This includes Community-Based Restoration, Diversion and Community 
Inpatient Facilities. 
4450 - Evaluation and Forensic Services is comprised of the Offender with a Mental Health Disorder and the Sex Offender 
Commitment Programs as well as the Incompetent to Stand Trial Re-Evaluation Services program. 
4450010 - The Department is required to provide forensic evaluation services to determine if an inmate within the California 
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, prior to parole, requires continued treatment in a state hospital as an Offender 
with a Mental Health Disorder or as a Sexually Violent Predator as a condition of parole. The Department administers these 
services through the Offender with a Mental Health Disorder Program and the Sex Offender Commitment Program. 
4450020 - The Re-Evaluation Services for Felony Incompetent to Stand Trial program allows the Department to re-evaluate 
individuals deemed felony IST, who have been waiting in jail pending transfer to a Department restoration of competency

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4181 - The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs 
through financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization, and renewable energy services. 
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households 
to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related 
emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard 
the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-
income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides energy efficiency and renewable energy services in low-income 
single-family farmworker and multi-family dwellings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs. LIWP 
projects include energy efficient weatherization and solar photovoltaic system installations. 
4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES 
The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is designed to enable local government and nonprofit community organizations 
to help low-income families achieve and maintain economic security through a broad range of services and activities. These 
include education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and 
nutritional services, among others. 
The California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax 
credits to boost the income of eligible individuals and families. Since 2016-17, the Department has worked with the Franchise 
Tax Board to provide grant opportunities for community-based organizations to increase awareness of CalEITC and free tax 
preparation assistance programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4210 - VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES 
The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program delivers employment services to individuals with disabilities through vocational 
rehabilitation professionals in district and branch offices located throughout the state so that individuals with disabilities may 
prepare for and engage in competitive, integrated employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In addition, the 
Department has cooperative agreements with state and local agencies (secondary and postsecondary education, behavioral/
mental health, and welfare) to provide services to consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection 
process, which gives priority to individuals with the most significant disabilities. 
Individuals with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided vocational 
assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, supported employment, and independent 
living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their communities. The Department provides 
Work Incentives Planning services to reduce dependency on public benefits. 
The Department additionally provides pre-employment transition services, known as DOR Student Services, to students with 
disabilities ages 16 to 22, including many who may benefit from early career development. DOR Student Services include job 
exploration counseling, work-based learning experiences, postsecondary education counseling, workplace readiness training, 
and instruction in self-advocacy.  
The Department, through its Business Enterprises Program, provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to 
enable individuals who are blind or visually impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and 
cafeterias. The Orientation Center for the Blind provides prevocational services, including employment readiness, to consumers 
with vision loss to prepare them for independent living and employment. 
The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation 
services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and 
establishes fees for services provided to its consumers. 
The Department administers the Pathways to Success Project (PSP) to increase competitive integrated employment outcomes, 
economic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion in high-wage, high-skill, and high-demand careers for individuals with 
disabilities. The PSP, which is a pilot research project, is particularly targeted at underrepresented communities, including 
people of color, women, and individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities.  
The Department administers the California Subminimum Wage to Competitive Integrated Employment Project (CSP) to provide 
a comprehensive set of interventions and supports to increase competitive integrated employment outcomes, independence, 
economic self-sufficiency, and inclusion for individuals with the most significant disabilities currently in, contemplating entering, 
or who have been historically diverted to subminimum wage employment. The CSP, which is a pilot research project, will 
establish evidence-based approaches to vocational rehabilitation service delivery that will improve the employment outcomes 
of its participants, transitioning more workers with disabilities into competitive integrated employment. 
4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES 
The Department funds, administers, and supports non-profit independent living centers throughout California. Each 
independent living center supports consumers to live independently with full inclusion in their communities. Core services 
consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems change advocacy, independent living skills, housing 
assistance, personal assistance referral services, assistive technology, transition and diversion services to community-based 
living, and transition services to postsecondary life for youth. 
The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their 
families, service providers throughout California provide a coordinated, post-acute care service model for individuals with TBI, 
including enhanced information and assistance, community navigation, person-centered case coordination, supported living, 
community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for family, friends, and professionals 
within the TBI community. The Department also works with the federal government to administer a TBI State Partnership 
Program grant with which a state TBI Advisory Board has been established for the purpose of creating a TBI state plan, 
sustainability plan, statewide TBI registry, and needs assessment. 
The Department administers the Older Individuals Who Are Blind and Services for the Blind programs that support non-profit, 
community-based organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to 
assist visually impaired consumers to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low 
vision evaluations/screenings, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, 
independent living skills training, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services. 
The Department operates the California Assistive Technology (AT) Program. The AT Program supports state efforts to improve 
the provision of AT to individuals with disabilities of all ages through comprehensive, statewide programs that are consumer 
responsive. The AT Program makes devices and services more available and accessible to individuals with all types of 
disabilities and their families. The AT Program provides local level and state leadership activities design to support individuals 
with disabilities to access and acquire the AT that they need.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM 
The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing 
parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and 
enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-
D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families block grant. 
4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION: 
The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating 
expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The 
federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs. 
4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION: 
Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal 
certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State 
Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts 
and locate and intercept assets of persons ordered to pay support who are delinquent in their child support payments. The 
Child Support Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child 
support payments from persons paying support and disburses payments to persons receiving support. In addition, the Child 
Support Automation program provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local 
agencies.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS 
The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support 
themselves. These programs are comprised of five components: 
• California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) 
• Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food 
Assistance Programs 
• Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program 
• County Administration and Automation Projects 
• Disaster Relief 
The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to 
enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor, 
administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services. 
4270010 - CalWORKs: 
The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is 
California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic 
needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes 
specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet 
these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs 
recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Parents have the right to choose child care 
among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs families are then able to meet both 
goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and development services. 
4270019 - Other Assistance Payments: 
The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term 
residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as 
a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is 
administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social 
Services as authorized by federal and state law. 
The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to relative guardians of children who were 
previously in the foster care system. 
The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate 
the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in 
accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and 
state law. 
California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs: 
• The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States 
provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs. 
• The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and 
independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States 
unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the 
minor. 
• The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human 
trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are 
available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under 
CalWORKs). 
The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of 
nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of 
purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations 
eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits 
due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program. 
The CalFresh Employment and Training Program allows certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in 
employment and training activities.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The federal SUN Bucks program provides summer food benefits to school-age children who qualify for free or reduced-priced 
meals. Eligible children are provided with $40 per month for June, July, and August for a total of $120. 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution 
to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for 
household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with 
food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a 
state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses. 
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious 
supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity 
Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services 
on October 1, 2016. 
4270020 - Child Care and Development: 
The Child Care and Development program transitioned to the Department of Social Services from the Department of 
Education, effective July 1, 2021. The Child Care and Development program includes CalWORKs Stages One, Two, and 
Three; the Emergency Child Care Bridge Program; California Alternative Payment Program; Migrant Child Care; General Child 
Care; Child Care for Children with Disabilities; Family Child Care Home Education Networks and a variety of local supports for 
these programs, such as Resource and Referral Programs and Local Child Care Planning Councils, in addition to quality 
improvement projects and the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Families can access child care subsidies through centers or 
family child care home education networks that contract directly with DSS, or vouchers from county welfare departments and 
alternative payment programs. 
4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program: 
The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled 
persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a 
State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who 
determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients. 
4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects: 
Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who 
administer public assistance programs. 
Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services. 
4270046 - Disaster Relief: 
The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have 
suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance 
programs, and to oversee mass care and shelter, social services recovery, emergency repatriation, and administration of select 
recovery grants. 
4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING 
The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child 
welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and 
procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of 
the service delivery system. 
4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services: 
The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in 
their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who 
either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs 
that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option, 
and IHSS-Residual Program. 
4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing: 
The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse 
Prevention. 
Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and 
prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated 
services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with 
the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and 
least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from 
foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff.

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is responsible for implementing continuum of care 
reforms codified in Chapter 773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to 
services without having to change out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and 
families in assessment and case planning. 
The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and 
private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for 
children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services 
include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents; 
training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For 
independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the 
biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice. 
The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and 
sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and 
services for at risk families and their children. 
The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of abuse, neglect, or financial 
exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary. 
The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health 
and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes 
facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components. 
4275028 - Special Programs: 
These programs include but are not limited to programs such as Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance, 
Access Assistance to the Deaf, Housing Program, Refugee Programs, Immigration, and Legal Services for Unaccompanied 
and Undocumented Minors. 
4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES 
The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and 
provide administrative services to other agencies. 
4285010 - Disability Evaluation: 
The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents 
applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of 
the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and 
overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. 
4285019 - Services to Other Agencies: 
In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative 
services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human 
Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public 
information services.

5195   1991 State-Local Realignment 
In the 1991-92 fiscal year, State-Local Program Realignment restructured the state-county partnership by giving counties 
increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment 
provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT 
The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve 
improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability 
for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage 
cost-effective approaches to providing services. 
Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts 
are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified 
in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to 
ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision 
ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for 
county health and social services programs.

5196   2011 State-Local Realignment 
Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a 
dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility. 
Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services, 
and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is 
appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and 
technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at 
less cost. 
The funding sources for realignment are: 
• The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax. 
• The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts: 
• Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services) 
• Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care; 
Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment) 
• Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs) 
• Trial Court Security Subaccount 
• Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and 
Adult Parole) 
• Community Corrections Subaccount 
• District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount 
• Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant 
Special Account) 
The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on 
statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures.
