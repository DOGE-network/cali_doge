3900   State Air Resources Board 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources, fuels, consumer products, and industrial sources 
established by the Board and local air districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility to develop measures to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 
(AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 32). The Air Resources Board oversees an extensive portfolio of incentives 
intended to reduce air pollution (including greenhouse gases), support shifts towards less-polluting transportation options, and 
advance zero emission technologies, among other purposes. The Air Resources Board is also responsible for developing 
guidance for agencies administering California Climate Investments programs to ensure statutory requirements of the 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund are met, including maximizing benefits for disadvantaged communities, reporting, and 
quantification methods, pursuant to Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014 (SB 862), and serves as the account administrator for the 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce 
air pollution in the State's most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources 
Board works with local air districts, the business community, scientists, community representatives, and other stakeholders to 
implement its programs. 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
Cap and Trade Expenditure Plan—The Budget includes $260 million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and $40 million 
General Fund in 2022-23, and an additional $300 million General Fund in 2023-24 to support the AB 617 program, which 
reduces emissions in communities with disproportionate exposure to air pollution through targeted air monitoring and 
community emissions reduction programs. The Budget also includes $100 million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in 2022-23 
to expand the number of satellites launched for methane observations, which would provide weekly measurement of large 
methane emissions in the state and enhance enforcement capabilities. 
Zero Emission Vehicle Package—The Budget includes $676 million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, $1.5 billion Proposition 
98 General Fund, and $383 million federal funds as part of a $6.1 billion package to equitably scale the zero emission vehicle 
market and accelerate the state toward meeting its climate and transportation goals. The remaining $3.5 billion General Fund 
will be allocated in the summer pending additional discussions with the Legislature. This funding builds upon the $3.9 billion of 
investments in the 2021 Budget Act and includes funding to support: zero emission drayage trucks and transit buses; Clean 
Trucks, Buses, and Off-Road Equipment; Clean Cars 4 All and other equity programs; zero emission vehicles around ports; 
emerging opportunities; and Sustainable Community Strategies and other community-based plans, projects, and support. 
Advancing Racial Equity—The Budget includes $1.8 million Air Pollution Control Fund and 4 positions in 2022-23 and ongoing 
to advance racial equity efforts within the Air Resources Board’s internal and external operations, with an initial focus on 
research, incentive programs, regulations, air quality planning, and climate change. 
Sustainable Agriculture Package - The Budget includes $150 million General Fund in 2022-23 for the Air Resources Board as 
part of a $1.1 billion package for investments that support the reduction of agricultural sector emissions by providing grants, 
rebates, and other financial incentives for agricultural harvesting equipment, heavy-duty trucks, agricultural pump engines, 
tractors, and other diesel equipment used in agricultural operations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE 
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as 
follows: 
• Developing, implementing, and enforcing laws, regulations, and programs limiting criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and 
2022-23 STATE BUDGET — EP 4

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
toxic air contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assessing the effectiveness of 
established procedures. 
• Developing testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuels and fuel additives, 
and testing equipment to ensure emission standards are met. 
• Overseeing incentive programs that provide funding to replace existing vehicles and engines, purchase new vehicles and 
engines, plan and implement improved transportation projects, otherwise upgrade or replace air pollution sources, and 
advance zero emission technologies 
3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE 
The Stationary Source Program works to reduce emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as 
follows: 
• Developing, implementing, and enforcing measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by 
the California Clean Air Act and working with local air districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient air quality 
standards. 
• Identifying substances that are toxic air contaminants and developing, implementing, and enforcing measures to control toxic 
air contaminant emissions from stationary sources. 
3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, as 
follows: 
• Enforcing laws and developing, implementing, and enforcing regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission 
reductions and other requirements of AB 32 and SB 32. 
• Developing, implementing, and overseeing programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, 
and other incentive programs. 
3515 - SUBVENTION 
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air districts to encourage and support effective district programs. The 
state's 35 local air districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary sources of air pollution in California. 
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM 
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing 
competitive funding to advance implementation of zero/near-zero emission warehouses and technology. The intent of the 
program is to develop state-of-the-art facilities with the lowest possible emissions. 
3530 - THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM 
The Community Air Protection Program works to reduce air pollution in California's most burdened communities by identifying 
priority communities most burdened by cumulative air pollution impacts and by developing and implementing: 
• Community emission reduction and community monitoring programs. 
• A technology clearinghouse. 
• A statewide uniform system of annual emissions reporting. 
• Community Air Grants.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Air Resources Board has 58 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 57 sites are occupied through 
lease, permit, or license agreements. Of the non state-owned sites, 35 support air-monitoring stations and 22 sites support an 
array of vehicle testing, research, planning, enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs; 
some of the support sites are also equipped with an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air 
Resources Board oversees to support its statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's 
exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air 
Resources Board leadership role related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.
