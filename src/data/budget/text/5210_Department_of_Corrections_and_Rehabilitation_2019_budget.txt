MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Adult Inmate and Parolee Population–Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the adult inmate average daily population is 
projected to decrease by 1,019 in 2019-20, to a total of 125,871. Compared to 2018-19 at the 2018 Budget Act, the 2019 
Budget Act projects an increase in the average daily parolee population of 1,907 in 2019-20, to a total of 50,442. 
• Adult Medical and Pharmaceutical Program–Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the population of adult inmates in CDCR-
operated prisons receiving in-prison medical services is projected to increase by 443 in 2019-20, to a total of 117,896. Based 
on the current Medical Classification Model staffing ratios and pharmaceutical cost projection, these changes will result in 
General Fund expenditure increases of $23.3 million in 2018-19 and $26.3 million in 2019-20. 
• Juvenile Ward Population–Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the ward population is projected to increase by 136 in 
2019-20 to a total of 782. The increase is driven by continued implementation of the Young Adult Program, which redirects 
certain young adult male offenders from adult prison into a juvenile facility. These changes result in General Fund 
expenditure increases of $3.6 million in 2018-19 and $15 million in 2019-20, exclusive of revenues and adjustments to 
reimbursement authority. These amounts also include corrections for certain living units originally budgeted in prior years. 
• Mental Health Program–Compared to the 2018 Budget Act, the population of inmates requiring outpatient mental health 
treatment is projected to decrease by 306 in 2019-20, to a total of 35,360. Based on the current Mental Health Staffing 
Ratios the Mental Health Program will note General Fund expenditure decreases of $1.1 million in 2018-19 and $8.7 million 
in 2019-20. 
• Prison Roof Replacements–The Budget includes a total of $71.7 million General Fund over two years for roof replacement 
projects at High Desert State Prison and California State Prison, Solano, as part of a broad, multiyear plan to replace aging 
and deteriorating roofs across the state prison system. 
• Integrated Substance Use Disorder Treatment Program–The Budget includes $71.3 million General Fund in 2019-20, 
increasing to $164.8 million ongoing General Fund in 2021-22, to implement a statewide integrated substance use disorder 
treatment program. The program includes use of medication-assisted treatment to treat inmates with opioid and alcohol use 
disorders, redesign of the current cognitive behavioral treatment curriculum, development and management of inmate 
treatment plans, as well as substance use disorder-specific pre-release transition planning. 
• Contract Medical Augmentation–The Budget includes $61.9 million one-time General Fund to support the expanded 
usage of contract medical services for inmates who require treatment that cannot be provided in prison clinical environments.

• Fire Alarm Replacement and Fire System Repair–The Budget includes a total of $59 million General Fund over two years 
to replace fire alarm systems and repair fire suppression systems at Mule Creek State Prison, R.J. Donovan Correctional 
Facility, and California State Prison, Sacramento. These funds will replace aging and outdated fire alarm systems and bring 
the existing fire suppression systems into code compliance. 
• Medical Classification Model Updates–The Budget includes $27.9 million ongoing General Fund for the Receiver's 
Medical Classification Model to provide increased staffing levels for health care operations throughout California’s prison 
system. The Medical Classification Model uses a ratio-based methodology for adjusting medical staffing levels based on 
inmate medical classification. The inmate population has grown older and sicker and is experiencing an increase in trauma-
related incidents, which requires an update to specific model factors that determine resource needs. 
• Fleet–The Budget includes $23.7 million one-time General Fund to replace fleet assets that serve mission-critical functions. 
• Prison Maintenance–The Budget includes $18.5 million General Fund to establish a new funding methodology and 
increase the baseline budget for annual prison maintenance and repair costs based on a square footage rather than a per 
inmate calculation.  The Budget also includes $25 million one-time General Fund to address the Department's highest 
priority deferred maintenance projects. 
• Division of Juvenile Justice Reorganization–The Budget includes $1.2 million ongoing General Fund to facilitate 
transition of the Division of Juvenile Justice to the California Health and Human Services Agency, as well as to launch a new 
independent training institute. The Budget also includes $1.4 million ongoing General Fund to establish a partnership 
between the Division of Juvenile Justice and the California Conservation Corps to develop and implement an apprenticeship 
program, which will provide skill building and job training opportunities. The Budget also includes $8 million ongoing General 
Fund to establish therapeutic communities to provide youth with opportunities to discuss, demonstrate, and practice values 
and skills related to building positive and supportive relationships that transcend racial and gang grouping and mentality, 
intended to reduce violence and improve program participation. 
• Inmate Complaint Process–The Budget includes $9.8 million ongoing General Fund to implement a new regional model for 
reviewing inmate complaints of staff misconduct. This new approach is intended to improve the Department’s ability to 
review and respond to potential staff misconduct issues. It will also improve objectivity and reduce bias, increase training for 
appropriate staff and management, and establish internal auditing of the inquiry process. 
• Reentry Program Expansion–The Budget includes $8.8 million General Fund to establish two new 60-bed female facilities 
in Los Angeles and Riverside, and expand an existing male facility in Los Angeles by 10 beds. In addition, the Budget 
includes $1.5 million ongoing General Fund to provide a five percent contract rate increase for Male Community Reentry 
Program providers. 
• Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Improvements–The Budget includes a total of $8.4 million General Fund 
over two years to fund accessibility improvements at the California Institution for Women and Mule Creek State Prison. 
These resources will result in various modifications that include, but are not limited to, cells, dorms, showers, restrooms, 
paths of travel, doors, handrails, and drinking fountains. 
• Receiver: Telehealth Expansion–The Budget includes $6 million limited-term General Fund to provide increased staffing, 
facilities, and infrastructure support for expanding the Telehealth Program, which utilizes audio-visual technology and other 
electronic means to connect patients with clinicians via the internet. The funding will also support implementation of a 
disaster recovery plan for networking and data storage infrastructure. 
• Inmate Literacy–The Budget includes $5.5 million ongoing General Fund for improving inmate literacy, including a statewide 
expansion of the Literacy Mentor Program, which trains inmates to tutor other inmates. 
• California Reentry and Enrichment (CARE) grant program–The Budget includes $5 million ongoing General Fund to 
establish the CARE program to provide grants to community-based organizations that provide insight-oriented restorative 
justice and offender accountability programs. 
• Supplemental Reforms to Parole Consideration–The Budget includes $4.7 million General Fund to expand the Board of 
Parole Hearings staff. These staff are needed to address the increase in Proposition 57 related parole suitability hearings for 
inmates serving indeterminate life sentences pursuant to California’s “Three Strikes” law. 
• Enacted Legislation–The Budget includes $4.1 million General Fund for costs associated with the implementation of 
legislation that affects CDCR, including: $1.4 million to make certain records of personnel investigations available for public 
review (SB 1421); $1.4 million to provide the Board of Parole Hearings resources to address anticipated increases of pardon 
and commutation reviews (AB 2845); $681,000 to create and maintain records of peace officer misconduct (AB 2327); 
$508,000 in 2019-20 to comply with new prescription authorization requirements (SB 1447); and $181,000 to comply with 
newly enacted Suicide Watch reporting requirements (SB 960). 
• Restorative Justice–The Budget includes $2 million ongoing Inmate Welfare Fund to expand the Office’s Victim Offender 
Dialogue program, which employs restorative justice principles to provide opportunities for offenders to understand the

impacts their actions have had on victims, and to establish or expand Innovate Programming Grants targeting victim impact 
programs. 
• Receiver: Educational Partnerships Program–The Budget includes $1.8 million limited-term General Fund to expand and 
evaluate the Educational Partnerships Program, which places medical professional students and recent graduates in 
temporary residency and internship positions within state prisons to develop critical on-the-job skills and to improve 
recruitment and retention. 
• Sign Language Interpreters–The Budget includes $1.5 million ongoing General Fund to provide equal access to 
rehabilitation programs and services to inmates for whom sign language is their primary method of communication. 
• Tattoo Removal Program–The Budget includes $1.1 million General Fund in 2019-20, and $2.1 million General Fund 
through 2022-23, to expand the tattoo removal program for the adult inmate population. This funding will allow the 
Department to remove tattoos from approximately 3,000 additional offenders annually with a focus on those who are seeking 
to leave gangs or are within 1 to 2 years of release on a voluntary basis.

departmental staff. 
4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES 
The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services

4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS 
The Department accepts commitments from California courts when the person to be committed meets age requirements, can 
materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there are adequate facilities available to care for the individual. 
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program is to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and 
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility 
operations. In addition, this program provides staff training, juvenile offender intake and court services, population management 
services, facility maintenance, and maintains juvenile offender master files. This program currently oversees operations for 
three facilities and one conservation camp. 
Treatment programs begin with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 
release planning for each offender. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based treatment 
programs are recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption therapy, 
sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp programs, 
and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs are designed to promote positive social behavior and 
reduce recidivism and relapse. 
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operates as a local education agency known as the 
California Education Authority. Its mission is to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and 
knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release. 
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs are accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges and include core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students must meet the California Common Core State 
Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services include special education, 
English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high school credit for 
work experience. 
4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program is to provide medical, dental, and mental health care consistent

Community Correctional Facilities, California Out-of-State Correctional Facilities, Community Reentry Facilities, and 
Community Prisoner Mother Program. 
4550 - ADULT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION OPERATIONS - INSTITUTION ADMINISTRATION 
The Adult Corrections and Rehabilitation Operations - Institution Administration program is responsible for the management 
and operation of 34 adult institutions, 1 leased facility, 43 conservation camps, and contracted facilities. The program focuses 
management's attention on program improvement and operational reforms. This program is also responsible for providing 
facility maintenance, asset management, and construction services for CDCR's adult facilities and other closed properties. In 
addition, the Office of Correctional Safety facilitates institution and public safety via security threat group management, 
escapee apprehension, major criminal investigations, and critical incident response training. 
4555 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT SUPERVISION 
The objective of the Parole Operations - Adult Supervision program is to improve public safety by increasing the rate and 
degree of successful reintegration and release to society of offenders paroled from state prison. The program is responsible for 
providing direct supervision, surveillance, and necessary apprehension of the state's parolee population. The main components 
of supervision include Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring, the Sex Offender Management Program which 
incorporates the containment model strategy as required by statute, and general caseload supervision utilizing the California 
Parole Supervision and Reintegration Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices into the Division of Adult Parole 
Operations' supervision strategies to elicit long-term behavioral change to reduce recidivism. 
Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the offender's risk 
and current service needs. Based on case assessments, parolees may be placed in a higher-supervision category intended to 
prevent, detect, or interrupt behavior likely to endanger the community. Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification 
are regularly scheduled based on parolee behavior and stability in the community. 
The other integral program component is the Parole Planning and Placement Program, which identifies parolee needs and 
matches them with state and local programs to support a successful transition into local communities. 
4560 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS

Transitional Work Programs, Cognitive Behavioral Treatment, Substance Use Disorder Treatment, and other Wraparound 
Services. The program includes a full continuum of transitional programs, including Integrated Services for Mentally Ill 
Parolees, the Transitional Case Management Program, and sex offender treatment for all sex offenders on parole. 
The program also provides mental health services and treatment to parolees through CDCR's Parole Outpatient Clinics. The 
objective of these services is to reduce recidivism through the stabilization and monitoring of the parolees' mental health 
issues. 
4565 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT ADMINISTRATION

CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
State Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders Committee is to select and train providers on the best evidence-
based risk assessment tools in the treatment of sex offenders. 
4575 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADULT HEARINGS 
The objective of the Board of Parole Hearings - Adult Hearings is to promote public safety through fair parole processes and 
decisions, and to provide the required due process to inmates throughout the hearing process. 
For adult offenders, the Board of Parole Hearings is responsible for setting the terms and conditions of parole and conducting 
parole consideration hearings for eligible inmates serving life sentences, including certain parole violators pursuant to Penal 
Code Section 3000.1. In January 2014, the Board began conducting youth offender parole hearings for eligible offenders 
sentenced under both the Indeterminate Sentence Law and Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to Chapter 312, Statutes of 
2013. In 2014, the Board also began conducting parole hearings for inmates eligible for elderly parole sentenced under both 
the Indeterminate Sentence Law and the Determinate Sentence Law, pursuant to a federal court order. Beginning in January 
2015, the Board started evaluating certain inmates sentenced under the state's Second Strike Law for parole, pursuant to the 
same federal court order. The Board also conducts medical parole hearings and determines whether parolees should be 
discharged from parole. Screenings are conducted for mentally disordered offenders and sexually violent predators, and 
subsequent hearing referrals are made to the Department of Mental Health. In addition, at the Governor's request, the Board 
investigates applications and forwards recommendations for pardons and commutations of sentence, including those involving 
the death penalty. It also has the discretion to recommend to the court that a prisoner's sentence be recalled due to the 
inmate's significant health condition. 
Chapter 312, Statutes of 2013 (SB 260) required the Board to establish parole suitability hearings for offenders who were under 
the age of 18 at the time they committed their controlling offense. Chapter 471, Statutes of 2015 (SB 261) extended the youth 
offender hearings to inmates who were under the age of 23 at the time of their offense. SB 261 specified that the Board 
complete a new comprehensive risk assessment for each youth offender scheduled for a parole hearing that specifically 
addresses the diminished culpability of juveniles as compared to that of adults, the hallmark features of youth, and any 
subsequent growth and increased maturity of the individual. Chapter 675, Statutes of 2017 (AB 1308) expands youth offender 
hearings to inmates who were under the age of 26 at the time of their offense. 
For juvenile offenders, the Juvenile Parole Board is responsible for discharges of commitment, orders for discharge from the 
jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Facilities to the jurisdiction of the committing court, and disciplinary appeals. 
4580 - BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS - ADMINISTRATION 
The Board of Parole Hearings - Administration program handles administrative duties in support of the Board's headquarters 
and field operations. The Administration is comprised of the Executive Team; the Administrative Services Division, which 
handles the business services functions for the Board; the Executive Analysis Unit, which develops system tools to monitor and 
track compliance; and the Legal Division, which provides legal support for the Board. 
4585 - REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS - ADULT EDUCATION 
The objective of the Rehabilitative Programs - Adult Education program is to contribute to public safety by designing and 
operating education programs that enable adult offenders to successfully reenter society. The Office of Correctional Education 
provides oversight to academic and vocational educational programs at 35 adult schools. The CDCR's schools are accredited 
by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges as post-secondary schools for the purpose of providing inmates a 
comprehensive adult education. The Office of Correctional Education develops education programs, curriculum, and policy to 
guide delivery of services to inmates. Academic and vocational programs provide inmates with an opportunity for improvement 
through basic education and career training. The Office of Correctional Education also oversees Adult Basic Education, Adult 
Secondary Education, and Voluntary Education programs. These programs include services from basic education through

5227   Board of State and Community Corrections 
The mission of the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) is to provide statewide leadership, coordination, and 
technical assistance to promote effective state and local efforts and partnerships in California's adult and juvenile criminal 
justice system, including technical assistance and coordination to local governments related to 2011 Public Safety 
Realignment. This mission reflects the principle of aligning fiscal policy and correctional practices including prevention, 
intervention, suppression, and supervision. The goal is to promote a justice investment strategy that fits each county and is 
consistent with the integrated statewide goal of improved public safety through cost-effective, promising, and evidence-based 
strategies for managing criminal justice populations. 
Because the Board of State and Community Corrections' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a 
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

establish minimum standards for personnel selection and training. This program also provides technical assistance to agencies 
to improve local training outcomes, administers a statewide training course certification process designed to ensure the 
competence of local corrections professionals, and provides funding to local agencies to offset a portion of the costs associated 
with meeting these training standards. 
4965 - COUNTY FACILITY CONSTRUCTION 
The objective of the County Facility Construction Program is to work in collaboration with state government and local 
corrections agencies in administering funding for local detention facility construction projects for the purpose of enhancing 
public safety and conditions of confinement within local jails and juvenile detention facilities.

5420   Prison Industry Authority 
The California Prison Industry Authority (CALPIA) is a self-supporting state entity operating California's correctional industries 
in a manner similar to private industry. The CALPIA is overseen by the Prison Industry Board, which acts much like a corporate 
board of directors. The Board is composed of 11 members, including the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (CDCR) or his or her designee, the Director of the Department of General Services or his or her designee, 
the Secretary of California State Transportation Agency or his or her designee, two public members appointed by the Speaker 
of the Assembly, two public members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, and four members appointed by the 
Governor representing organized labor and industry. The Secretary of the CDCR or his or her designee serves as chair of the 
Board. 
The CALPIA supports the public safety mission of the CDCR by producing well-trained offenders that have a job skill, good 
work habits, basic education, and job support in the community to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison. The CALPIA 
work programs also help the CDCR to avoid the cost of alternative inmate programming. 
The CALPIA has three statutory objectives: 1) develop and operate manufacturing, agricultural, and service enterprises that 
provide work opportunities for offenders under the jurisdiction of the CDCR; 2) create and maintain working conditions within 
enterprises similar to those which prevail in private industry to assure offenders assigned therein the opportunity to work 
productively to earn funds and to acquire or improve effective work habits and occupational skills; and 3) operate work 
programs for offenders that are self-supporting through the generation of sufficient funds from the sale of products and services 
to pay all program expenses, and which provide goods and services to be used by the CDCR, thereby reducing the costs of its 
operation. The CALPIA receives no annual appropriation from the Legislature.
