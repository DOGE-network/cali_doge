ambulance companies, and medical supply vendors, to promote and improve disaster preparedness and emergency medical 
response in California. 
Emergency Medical Services Personnel Division 
The Emergency Medical Services Personnel Division is responsible for licensing and enforcement actions of all active 
paramedics throughout the state. The Division develops and implements regulations that set training, certification and licensure
