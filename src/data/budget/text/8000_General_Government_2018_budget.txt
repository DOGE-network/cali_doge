PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6500 - STANDARDS
The Standards Program establishes job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers. It also
provides management consultation to local law enforcement agencies. Activities include development of examinations and
counseling local law enforcement agencies on ways to improve management practices.
The Program conducts applied research in the areas of peace officer selection and training, operational procedures and
program evaluation to meet statutory requirements and to provide management guidance to local law enforcement agencies. It
also facilitates the development and implementation of new programs for local agencies by serving as a clearinghouse of
successful program information. Finally, it conducts accreditation and peace officer feasibility studies.
6505 - TRAINING
The Training Program increases the competence of law enforcement personnel by developing and certifying courses that meet
identified training needs. This activity requires scheduling and quality control of such courses, and assisting law enforcement
agencies in presenting necessary training and career development programs to their officers. The Commission assesses
training on a continuing basis to ensure that evolving training needs are met. The curricula cover a wide variety of topics
necessary to satisfy statutory and regulatory mandates, maintain competence in police work, and address the training needs of
law enforcement agency personnel. Curricula content is updated regularly. The Program also presents advanced training for
law enforcement supervisors and executives through its Command College and the Supervisory Leadership Institute, and for
trainers through the Basic Academy Instructor Certificate Program and the Instructor Development Institute. Other specialty
programs include the Institute of Criminal Investigation.
Job-related selection and training standards for peace officers and dispatchers, established by the Standards Program, are
enforced through inspections of local agencies receiving state aid to ensure they are adhering to minimum state standards.
6510 - PEACE OFFICER TRAINING
The Peace Officer Training Program provides financial assistance to participating jurisdictions for instructional costs associated
with selected training courses. Funding is also provided for the cost of student travel and per diem expenses associated with
training presentations and for necessary overtime to enable line officers to receive in-service training in areas of critical need.
To encourage and assist local law enforcement agencies to meet and maintain minimum standards in the selection and training
of law enforcement officers, the Commission provides financial assistance to all 58 counties, approximately 346 cities, and
numerous specialized districts and local agencies which have agreed to meet the Commission's standards.
6515 - POST ADMINISTRATION
The objective of the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training is to be the leading organization in
establishing professional standards, assuring top-quality training, and providing effective services to develop and support
California law enforcement personnel. California POST utilizes the following eight bureaus to insure uniform standards and
compliance are applied to over 600 law enforcement agencies and 40 police academies statewide: Basic Training;
Management Counseling and Special Projects; Strategic Communications and Research; Learning Technology Resources;
Training Program Services; Training Delivery and Compliance; Computer Services, and Administrative Services.

California Arts Council
The California Arts Council (Council) consists of eleven members, nine appointed by the Governor and one each appointed by
the President pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly. The Council establishes general policy and
approves program allocations.
The Council recognizes that the Arts are essential for the cultural, educational, social and economic development of California.
The Council seeks to further its mandates and services to the public through the development of partnerships with the public
and private sectors and by providing support to the state's non-profit arts and cultural community, which are broad-based and
extended across the state from its largest metropolitan areas to its most rural areas.
The Council is statutorily required to:
•
Encourage artistic awareness, participation, and expression among the citizens of California.
•
Help independent local groups develop their own arts programs.
•
Promote the employment of artists and those skilled in crafts in both the public and private sectors.
•
Provide for the exhibition of art works in public buildings throughout California.
•
Enlist the aid of all state agencies in the task of ensuring the fullest expression of our artistic potential.

State Compensation Insurance Fund
State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) is a public enterprise fund established through legislation that was originally
enacted in 1913. State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing body of a
private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of directors for
approval.
State Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore
injured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers located
in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on policies
written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California, and the
State is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the California civil
service process and are actually employees of the State.
State Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the State and
because the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not
financially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund.
Most of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation coverage
and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to private
employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers'
compensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and
other subdivisions of the State of California under a Master Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the State provides a

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection, and Outdoor Access for All Act (SB 5)—The Budget includes
$31 million California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection, and Outdoor Access For All Fund on a one-time
basis and 9 positions to allow for initial implementation of the Act. This includes $18.4 million for the State Water Efficiency
and Enhancement Program, $9.1 million for the Healthy Soils Program, and $3.6 million to provide deferred maintenance
support to the Network of California Fairs. Funding for the fairs will provide more opportunities to generate self-sustaining
revenue and safer facilities for the public during events and for the emergency personnel who utilize the fairgrounds during
catastrophic events such as earthquakes, wildfires, and floods.
•
Continued Implementation of Cannabis Cultivation Licensing and Enforcement—The Budget includes $28.3 million Cannabis
Control Fund and $18.2 million in reimbursement authority, on a two-year limited-term basis, and 79 positions to continue
implementation of cannabis cultivation licensing and enforcement programs for recreational and medicinal cannabis.
Funding for these activities has been phased in based on the timing of statutory requirements, and these resources will
primarily support the ramp-up of annual licensing, compliance, and enforcement activities, as well as costs for proprietary
plant and package tags for use with the track-and-trace system.

California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses, (3) have severe negative impact on the environment, or (4)
adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the consumer.
6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES
California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The
objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural
commodities, promote consumer protection, food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported grading
services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the
marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products.
This program also provides licenses to eligible California cannabis cultivators and maintains a statewide cannabis tracking
system.
This program also provides support to governmental agencies that work to protect the nation's food supply and the
environment by monitoring for chemical contaminants such as pesticides in food, animal feed and fertilizers.
6580 - ASSISTANCE TO FAIRS AND COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES
This program provides limited fiscal and policy oversight to the network of California fairs.
The State has a network of 79 fairs including county fairs, citrus fruit fairs, District Agricultural Associations and the California
State Fair (an independent state agency). State oversight of these local fairs includes attendance of board meetings and
periodic financial reviews and audits.
6590 - GENERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES
This program provides the fiscal and policy oversight of the federal grants awarded that promote California agriculture, and for
all CDFA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program activities which are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
agriculture.
In addition, this program serves as the central point of contact for logistical coordination of all departmental resources, provides
industry and agency coordination on environmental issues affecting agriculture, and provides centralized communications to
California's agricultural industry, including County Agricultural Commissioners and the statewide fairgrounds.
This program also partially reimburses County Agricultural Commissioners' Offices for carrying out agricultural programs
authorized by the Food and Agricultural Code under the supervision of CDFA.
9900 - EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
Executive and Management Services include the executive leadership of the Secretary's Office. The Secretary's Office sets
priorities and policies to protect, support, and promote agriculture in the State of California, and helps to protect the health and
welfare of the public and the environment.
Administrative Services provides centralized administrative support to the Department through fiscal operations, employee-
employer relations, personnel management, employee development, and general business services.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6680 - REGULATION OF UTILITIES
Californians spend more than $50 billion annually for services from industries regulated by the PUC. This includes 6 electricity
utilities (70 percent of electric load in California), 937 telecommunications carriers, 120 water and sewer utilities, 5 natural gas
utilities with approximately 10.8 million customers, 4 gas facility owners, and more than 3,155 small mobile home park and
propane operators.
The PUC oversees the safety of electric, communications, natural gas, and propane gas utility systems. Safety functions
include both backward-looking investigation and analysis of safety incidents and utility performance, and forward-looking risk
assessment to identify necessary regulatory rule reform. The PUC also performs operation and maintenance audits, outage
inspections, and investigations of incidents at electric generation facilities.
The PUC conducts triennial reviews of utility operations to determine just and reasonable rates for energy services. The PUC
provides guidelines for investor-owned utilities and other load-serving entities to follow when purchasing electricity and natural
gas on behalf of their customers to ensure that sufficient amounts of electricity are procured when and where needed in the
state.
Environmental protection and the impact of climate change are critical factors in PUC regulation. The PUC is charged with
implementing and overseeing key components of Chapter 547, Statutes of 2015, (SB 350) and other climate change
legislation, including promoting ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, Integrated Resource Planning, the state's
mandated renewable energy programs, programs for disadvantaged communities, electric vehicle programs, and other clean
energy programs.
The PUC oversees programs and regulations to promote both natural gas and electricity reliability and resilience.
The PUC establishes requirements for energy programs for low-income ratepayers, including programs providing rate
discounts, financial assistance with energy bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides no-cost
weatherization services to customers who meet low-income eligibility criteria.
The PUC conducts and manages environmental reviews pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act for transmission,
telecommunications, and other infrastructure projects.
The PUC develops and implements policies for the rapidly changing communications and broadband markets, including
monitoring competitive markets for proper operation; enforcing customer service standards for telecommunication services;
regulating basic and rural telecommunication rates; protecting consumers against telecommunications fraud; promoting
widespread access to advanced video technology; and developing programs to bridge the "digital divide."
The PUC is responsible for ensuring that California's investor-owned water utilities deliver clean, safe, and reliable water to
their customers at reasonable rates. The PUC's water utility work includes investigating water and sewer service quality,
promoting water conservation and metering, improving low-income programs, analyzing and processing rate change requests,
and tracking and certifying compliance with PUC requirements.
The Public Advisor's Office provides procedural information, advice, and assistance to individuals and groups interested in
participating in PUC proceedings and advises the Commission on procedural matters related to public participation in
proceedings. The Consumer Affairs Branch responds to questions regarding utility service and bills, and assists consumers
who have unresolved disputes with regulated utilities through an informal process. A Supplier Diversity program promotes and
monitors supplier diversity in procurement by utilities and oversees a certification clearinghouse.
6685 - UNIVERSAL SERVICE TELEPHONE PROGRAMS
The PUC oversees approximately $770 million in telecommunication-based universal service programs (California Lifeline
Fund, California Teleconnect Fund, Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program, California Advanced Service Fund, and
California High Cost Funds), all of which provide needed services to consumers and communities. The objectives of these
"universal service" programs include: (1) ensuring basic telephone service is available to all Californians; (2) improving access
to broadband technology; and (3) ensuring consumers have access to sufficient information to make informed choices about
basic service and universal lifeline telephone services. The California Teleconnect Fund program provides discounted
telecommunication services to qualifying schools, libraries, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The California

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
Advanced Services Fund Program mainly encourages the deployment of broadband infrastructure in unserved and
underserved rural and urban areas of California.
6690 - REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION
The PUC oversees the safety of railroads, rail transit systems, rail crossings, and other forms of motor conveyance in
California. All railroads, 7 major rail transit agencies, 6 smaller transit systems, and more than 13,500 public and private
crossings are subject to PUC regulation and inspection. For traditional heavy rail, the PUC's specially trained and federally-
certified inspectors inspect all tracks (annually), all train equipment and facilities (thrice annually), and all signals and
appurtenances; investigate all rail accidents resulting in loss of life and property damage; and ensure safe transport of
hazardous materials by rail.
For rail transit systems, PUC inspectors and engineers conduct safety inspections of track, vehicles, signals and train control,
and operations, as well as overall agency triennial safety audits. The PUC also has exclusive authority to approve or
disapprove all highway-rail crossings of railroad or rail transit tracks, and crossing safety treatments deployed at each crossing.
Additionally, the PUC jointly (with Caltrans) administers the state's annual allocation of federal funds for crossing hazard
elimination projects and the state's grade separation program, which assists localities with the high cost of grade-separating
highway/rail crossings.
The transportation program also oversees passenger carriers, including privately-owned for-hire passenger transportation
companies (e.g., limousines, airport shuttles, and charter and scheduled bus operators) and privately-owned water ferries. The
program regulates rates and services, issues certificates and other licenses, enforces safety standards and insurance
requirements, and protects consumers from moving companies and for-hire passenger carriers operating illegally.
6695 - OFFICE OF RATEPAYER ADVOCATES
The mandate and function of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5. The
ORA is a statutorily-defined state entity charged with representing and advocating on behalf of public utility customers and
subscribers in all significant proceedings within the PUC's jurisdiction.
Chapter 856, Statutes of 1996 (SB 960), codified the ORA with a director appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the
Governor and charged the ORA with representing ratepayer interests in Commission proceedings. Chapter 1005, Statutes of
1999 (AB 1658), directed funds from the Public Utilities Commission Utilities Reimbursement Account to be transferred in the
annual budget act to the Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account. The law further required that "funds in the
Public Utilities Commission Ratepayer Advocate Account shall be utilized exclusively by the division in the performance of its
duties as determined by the director" [of ORA], and that the budget be submitted to the Commission for approval.
Chapter 440, Statutes of 2001 (SB 201), removed the limitation that ORA only represent ratepayers in PUC proceedings. SB
201 extended ORA's representation to other venues such as, but not limited to, the Energy Commission, Air Resources Board,
California Independent System Operator, and legislative hearings.
Chapter 440, Statutes of 2005 (SB 608), authorized the ORA director to appoint a lead attorney to represent the division and
that "all attorneys assigned by the Commission to perform services for the division shall report to and be directed by the lead
attorney appointed by the Director [of ORA]."
Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013 (SB 96), requires the creation of an independent ORA program budget administered and utilized
exclusively by ORA, subject to review and approval by the Department of Finance. SB 96 also requires the ORA director to
employ personnel and resources, including attorneys and other legal support staff, at a level sufficient to ensure that customer
and subscriber interests are effectively represented in all significant proceedings.

Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government
Organization and Economy
The Milton Marks "Little Hoover" Commission on California State Government Organization and Economy (Commission) is the
state's only independent and citizen-based oversight mechanism. It conducts four to five comprehensive reviews of executive
branch programs, departments, and agencies each year and recommends ways to improve performance by increasing
efficiency and effectiveness with existing resources. The Commission is statutorily responsible for analyzing and making
recommendations to the Legislature on all Governor reorganization plans.
The Commission is composed of two members of the Senate, two members of the Assembly, and nine unpaid citizen members
- five appointed by the Governor and four appointed by the Legislature.
Because of the Commission's independence, the Legislature charged it with oversight of the California State Auditor, including
contracting with an independent auditor for annually examining the State Audit Fund.

California Commission on Disability Access
The Commission on Disability Access was established in 2008 pursuant to Chapter 549, Statutes of 2008, and subsequently
redefined pursuant to Chapter 383, Statutes of 2012, to study existing disability access requirements and compliance, and to
promote better compliance with existing laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the California
Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Commission also acts as an information center on disability access compliance statutes and
regulations, coordinates with state agencies and local building departments, and prevents or minimizes compliance problems
by California businesses. Lastly, the Commission develops recommendations that enable persons with disabilities to exercise
their right to full and equal access to public facilities, and facilitate business compliance with laws and regulations to avoid
unnecessary litigation.

California State Auditor's Office
The California State Auditor (State Auditor) promotes the effective and efficient administration and management of public funds
and programs by providing citizens and government officials nonpartisan, accurate, and objective assessments of state and
local governments' financial and operational activities. As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants the State
Auditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-created entity.
The State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute or requested by
the Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is responsible for annually
conducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the State's basic financial statements
and the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The Single Audit is federally required as a
condition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the Legislature enacted a program that
requires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial courts in 2012-13 and thereafter
biennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five judicial branch entities - which
includes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center.
The State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, abuse,
and mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the authority
to conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk program, Chapter
451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to identify local
government agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high risk for the
potential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their economy, efficiency, or
effectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local entities.
Additionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform
independent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. The
State Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of improper
acts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law.
The Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an
application process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10
years. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and
conducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6770 - STATE BUDGET
To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance
advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget. The Governor's Budget
contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and proposed
expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of Finance assists in
the administration of the budget. The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state agencies and
programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within existing resources,
and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the Governor. Basic and
applied economic and tax research functions support the revenue estimates required for the development of the state financial
plan, for the analysis of financial legislation, and the evaluation of economic trends or other fiscal developments which affect
the state. Basic and applied demographic research functions provide data to support the workload estimates of state agencies.
6775 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA (FI$Cal) PROJECT SUPPORT
The Department of Finance is one of four partner agencies responsible for the development, implementation, utilization, and
maintenance of an integrated statewide financial management system, FI$Cal. This program includes Department of Finance
subject-matter experts assigned to the FI$Cal Project.
6780 - STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS
The Department of Finance systematically reviews and evaluates state-administered and financed programs. The Office of
State Audits and Evaluations assists the Director of Finance in fulfilling the statutory responsibilities for supervision over all
matters concerning the financial and business policies of the state by conducting financial audits and by performing critical
examinations of state programs and policies including the oversight activities associated with the dissolution of redevelopment
agencies. Effective July 1, 2017, Program 6800 (Local Government Audits and Evaluations) merged with Program 6780.
6785 - STATEWIDE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONSULTING AND TRAINING
The Statewide Accounting Policies, Consulting and Training Unit sets statewide accounting policies and procedures. The unit
provides fiscal consulting, training, and support services to departments to help ensure that the state's assets are protected

Military Department
The Military Department is responsible for the command, leadership and management of the California National Guard, Youth
and Community Programs, State Military Reserve and the Naval Militia. The California Military Department, under proper
authority, organizes, resources, and trains forces with unique capabilities to serve the community, state, and nation. The
purpose of the California National Guard is to provide mission ready forces to the federal government as directed by the
President, emergency public safety support to civil authorities as directed by the Governor, and support to our member's
families and to the community. With an authorized strength of 22,325, the Army National Guard and Air National Guard are
organized, manned, and funded in accordance with federal Departments of the Army and Air Force regulatory guidance.
The Military Department Youth and Community Program serves California communities and families by delivering national
level, high quality educational support programs, in partnership with the educational community, within a military, academic
structured environment. In addition to the funding that flows through the State Treasury, the Military Department also receives
federal funding directly from the Department of Defense. A special display titled "Other Federal Funds" shows the funding
received from this source.
Because the Military Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
6911 - NATIONAL GUARD
The Military Department will maximize the readiness of the California National Guard's Soldiers and Airmen, along with our
State Military Reserve. Army National Guard support plans include a community-based land force, logistics, communications,
law enforcement and other specialized support. Air National Guard support plans include rescue, air defense, airlift and
unmanned aerial systems, space, intelligence, communications, and other specialized services. The Office of the Adjutant
General element governs the joint activities and performance of the Military Department in areas such as personnel and fiscal
resource management, judicial affairs, internal controls, facility management, and information technology. The Military Civil
Support element provides liaison and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies so that mutual understanding and
unity of purpose is assured during an emergency. The objectives of this element are to plan, prepare, and train for the
deployment of Military Department personnel and equipment to support civil authority when called to state service by the
Governor due to domestic emergency or natural disaster and to provide the state, county, city, and other public agencies with
the coordination necessary to ensure a timely, organized response. The State Military Reserve is a volunteer component of the
Military Department whose mission is to provide a trained, disciplined and ready force during training, preparation for
mobilization, demobilization, and provision of support to civil authorities during periods of state emergencies. The federal
government provides virtually all supplies, equipment, transportation, subsistence, and support services necessary for training,
deployment, and commitment of the National Guard. Training is conducted in accordance with the Department of the Army and
Air Force Regulations and Training Guidance.
6912 - YOUTH AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS
The Military Department manages the following seven programs while serving more than 12,000 youth annually: California
Cadet Corps, Oakland Military Institute, Grizzly Youth Academy, Sunburst Youth Academy, Discovery ChalleNGe Academy,
STARBASE Academy Sacramento and STARBASE Academy Los Alamitos. The California Cadet Corps, founded in 1911 by
the California Legislature and then-Adjutant General BG Edwin Forbes, is a school-based, applied leadership program that is
designed to provide maximum growth and leadership opportunities for cadets from elementary through high school levels. It
provides leadership opportunities for cadets by allowing them to conduct training for junior cadets, perform as leaders in their
cadet military units, and by demonstrating proper behavior and citizenship at their schools and in their communities. As part of
their training, cadets provide assistance and support to the school and community. The Oakland Military Institute College
Preparatory Academy develops leaders of character by providing a rigorous seven-year college preparatory program to
promote excellence in the four pillars of academics, leadership, citizenship, and athletics. Using a military framework, the goal
of Oakland Military Institute is to graduate cadets who are capable of meeting the admissions requirements for any college in
the nation and who are prepared for their roles as future leaders. The mission of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program
is to intervene in and reclaim the lives of 16-18 year old high school dropouts. Graduates leave the program with the values, life
skills, education, and self-discipline necessary to succeed as productive citizens. The goal of the Department of Defense
STARBASE program is to motivate elementary school students, primarily 5th graders, to explore Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math (STEM) as they continue their education. The curriculum is designed to increase student involvement
and interest in STEM, enhance their understanding of the role that STEM literacy plays in their lives, strengthen potential for
future careers, and make the pursuit of STEM activities more attractive and accessible. While attending STARBASE students
interact with military personnel to explore careers and observe STEM applications in the "real world." These seven youth
programs are financed with federal, state and local funds. The California National Guard is involved in youth programs because
political and community leaders at the federal, state, and local levels recognize that the National Guard brings structure,
discipline, and effective leadership training methods to the educational setting.

Department of Veterans Affairs
The California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) honors and serves California's veterans and their families by ensuring
our veterans have access to the benefits they have earned to enable them to meet their needs. The CalVet promotes and
delivers innovative services through efficient, cost-effective programs and collaboration with key stakeholders and partners.
More specifically, the CalVet:
•
Communicates with California's veterans and their families at all pivotal moments throughout their post-military lives to
educate them and connect them to their federal, state, and local benefits.
•
Provides California veterans and their families with direct representation in presenting their claims and appeals for benefits
before the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Board of Veteran Appeals.
•
Provides California veterans the opportunity to achieve the American dream of homeownership through direct low-cost loans
to acquire farms and homes.
•
Provides the state's aged or disabled veterans with premier rehabilitative, residential, and medical care and services in a
home-like environment at the California Veterans Homes.
This mission is based upon the philosophy that benefit programs for veterans fulfill necessary, proper, and valid public
purposes; promote patriotism; recognize and reward sacrifice and service to our country; and provide needed readjustment
assistance to returning veterans and their families, whose lives were interrupted when they responded to our country's call to
military service.
Because the CalVet's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
The Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) facilities include eight veterans homes, three state veterans cemeteries, a
headquarters office building, and various county veterans services offices statewide. The eight veterans homes are located in
Yountville, Barstow, Chula Vista, Ventura, Lancaster, West Los Angeles, Redding and Fresno on 766 acres of land, with 2.4
million gross square feet of building space. Veterans homes provide domiciliary housing for the state's veterans and are also
licensed to provide three levels of care, ranging from assisted living to skilled nursing. The three cemeteries operated by CalVet
are located in Igo, near Redding, Yountville, and Seaside, and contain a total of approximately 24,000 gravesites on 91 usable
acres. A fourth state cemetery is in the study phase, and will be located on 125 acres in Southern California, known as the
Bake Parkway site.

Tax Relief
This budget provides funding for cities and counties to help defray the loss of revenue as a result of the Homeowners' Property
Tax Relief Program, that provides California homeowners assistance through a $7,000 exemption from property tax, and the
Open Space Subventions Program, that provides tax relief to individuals who agreed to hold their land as open space under the
Williamson Act of 1965. In addition, this budget receives the excess funds from loan repayments from individuals who
participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program, provides funding to help cities and counties
accurately report population data for the 2020 United States Census, and helps defray the local agency costs of recall elections
in 2018.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
7500 - HOMEOWNERS' PROPERTY TAX RELIEF
In order to reduce California taxpayers' property tax burden, the California Constitution exempts homeowners from paying
property taxes on the first $7,000 of the assessed value of their principal place of residence. The Constitution requires the state
to reimburse local governments for revenues lost due to the homeowners' exemption.
7505 - SUBVENTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE
The Williamson Act permits cities and counties to enter into contracts with landowners to limit the use of land to agricultural,
scenic, and open space purposes. Article XIII, Section 8, of the California Constitution permits land under such restrictions to
be assessed at other than market value based on its limited uses. The state provides reimbursements to cities and counties to
partially defray the loss of property tax revenues. The Department of Conservation administers this program.
7510 - SENIOR CITIZENS' PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT LOAN REPAYMENTS
The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program allows eligible homeowners to defer payment of residential property
tax. The state pays the deferred taxes to local governments on behalf of the participants, and places a lien on their property to
assure repayment when the property is sold or transferred. The Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Loan Repayments
Program captures repayments from individuals that participated in the Senior Citizens' Property Tax Postponement Program
and transfers to the General Fund the amount in excess of what is required to fund the Postponement Program claims. The
Program was suspended in 2009 and was reestablished via legislation in 2014 (Chapter 703, Statutes of 2014).
7515 - RECALL ELECTIONS
Recall Elections provides funding for counties to pay for the costs of state recall elections in 2018, including expenses for
verifying signatures, printing ballots and voter information guides, and operating polling places in accordance with Section
11108 of the Elections Code.
7520 - LOCAL UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESS PROGRAM
The Local Update of Census Address Program provides population-based incentive grants of between $7,500 and $125,000 to
cities and counties, to ensure they participate in the review and update of the United States Census Bureau's Master Address
List for the 2020 Census.

2General Obligation bond expenditures include repayment of debt service for various departments funded by a series of bonds; however, the state may 
assign each maturity of the bonds to one or more departments, rather than having all of the debt allocated to a department mature proportionally across the 
entire maturity schedule.  Regardless of the debt service allocated among departments, the aggregate debt service obligation of the state remains the same.
3Includes higher education debt service paid through the University of California and California State University main budget items.

Lease-Revenue Notes and Bonds
This budget is limited to those long-term lease arrangements, generally resulting in a capital acquisition or improvement, for
which a bond has been issued as the underlying source of funds. This budget reflects expenditures for the appropriations
necessary for the lease payments that are contained in the support budgets of the affected departments or agencies and may
vary from this display because of reimbursements from bond surplus accounts. This display is intended to meet the needs of
the financial community for summary information relating to lease-revenue debt.

Enhanced Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed Bonds
In accordance with Government Code section 63049.1, the Enhanced Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed Bonds item
appropriates $1,000 and authorizes the Director of Finance to allocate up to $200 million General Fund if tobacco settlement
revenues are insufficient to pay the costs of debt service and operating expenses. While this authority was necessary to sell the
Tobacco Settlement Revenue backed bonds, it is not anticipated that the General Fund will be required to make any payments.

Cash Management and Budgetary Loans
The Cash Management and Budgetary Loans budget tracks General Fund expenditures for interest costs related to cash flow
and budgetary borrowing. Internal and external cash flow borrowing can be used to overcome normal cash flow imbalances
during the fiscal year. Because receipts and disbursements occur unevenly throughout the fiscal year, the General Fund may
need to borrow even though its budget is balanced. Budgetary loans may be used to loan monies from various state funds to
the General Fund to help bridge a budget shortfall. These loans are temporary, and do not harm the operations of departmental
programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
7720 - CASH MANAGEMENT
Borrowing From Other Funds or Other State/Local Entities
Chapter 312, Statutes of 1907, authorized the transfers to the General Fund from certain specified funds (often referred to as
"borrowable" funds) in the State Treasury System whenever the General Fund was exhausted. Those provisions, in slightly
modified form, are now contained in Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code. This authorization enables the
General Fund to overcome normal cash flow imbalances throughout the fiscal year to a large extent. The use of these funds'
money for General Fund cash flow purposes is largely transparent to most of these funds. This mechanism does not interfere
with the day-to-day cash needs of the borrowable funds because of the implementation method. Generally, when a fund is
designated as borrowable for General Fund cash flow purposes, it merely increases the amount of cash the State Controller's
Office is authorized to borrow from the Pooled Money Investment Account (PMIA) when there is a General Fund cash
shortage. For most of these funds, actual cash is not transferred out of the funds into the General Fund. The entire cash
balances of these funds remain intact and completely available for the funds' purposes.
GENERAL GOVERNMENT
2018-19 STATE BUDGET — GG 181
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
A State Agency Investment Fund (SAIF) Program was enacted pursuant to Chapter 142, Statutes of 2011 (Senate Bill 79,
Government Code section 16330), to increase internal borrowable resources through the receipt of deposits from a state entity
that is not required to deposit or invest funds in the PMIA. The minimum deposit or investment per participant is $500 million
and the maximum amount for the SAIF Program for all participants is $10 billion. There are currently no deposits in this
Program.
A Voluntary Investment Program (VIP) was enacted pursuant to Chapter 44, Statutes of 2012 (Senate Bill 1033, Government
Code section 16340), for the receipt of voluntary deposits from local entities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity for
the state's cash management. The minimum deposit from a local entity is $200 million and the maximum amount for the VIP
from all local entities combined is $10 billion. No deposits have been made into this Program.
Borrowing From Financial Markets
In addition, the courts have validated temporary external borrowing that meets the "appropriation doctrine." Under this doctrine,
an obligation is not considered a debt or liability within the State Constitutional limitation on indebtedness (Section 1 of Article
XVI) if an appropriation is made from existing funds or reasonably anticipated funds subject to appropriation. This doctrine was
invoked in 1933 and 1936 to uphold the use of registered warrants (IOUs) during the Great Depression and again in 1971 to
validate the State of California Notes provisions of Chapter 223, Statutes of 1971. The Notes provisions were invoked in
1971-72 in lieu of the more costly registered warrant authority used during the Depression and, like registered warrants,
required the projected exhaustion of all internal sources of funds before being implemented. The Notes provisions were re-
enacted by Chapter 10X, Statutes of 1983, and employed in 1982-83 and 1983-84.
In 1984-85, the state implemented a cash management program pursuant to Chapter 268, Statutes of 1984, which provided the
flexibility to borrow from external sources prior to exhausting internal sources. Under this program, the use of external funds
results in potential savings to the General Fund, as well as increased revenue to the various special funds from which the
General Fund would have borrowed from pursuant to Sections 16310 and 16418 of the Government Code.
External sources of borrowing available to the state include revenue anticipation notes (RANs), revenue anticipation warrants
(RAWs), and registered warrants (short-term IOUs). RANs and RAWs are short-term debt obligations issued in anticipation of
receiving revenues in the near future.
Additional costs to the cash management program include, but are not limited to, costs to issue and redeem IOUs, and any
other program measures necessary to effectively manage cash flow.
Overall Program
Pursuant to Government Code Sections 12020 and 12021, accounts payable and receivable and cash flow statements for the
past, current, and budget years are included as Schedule 5 in the Governor's Budget Summary. Neither cash receipts nor
disbursements match revenues and expenditures presented elsewhere in this Budget. To reflect cash flow, budget data is
converted to cash basis primarily by adjusting for cash collected by an agency but not yet recorded by the Controller and for
accruals. Adjustments are also made to reflect statutory changes, anticipated legislative actions, and administrative actions.
The estimated current and budget year cash flows incorporate the latest revenue and expenditure budget measures and
assumptions. During difficult cash periods, cash management measures such as intra-year payment deferrals may be used
from time-to-time to address low points during the fiscal year.
7725 - BUDGETARY LOANS
The Budget Act authorizes budgetary loans from various funds and accounts to the General Fund. These loans are repaid over
multiple fiscal years. Unless otherwise specified in statute, the loans are repaid with interest calculated at the Pooled Money
Investment Account rate on the date of transfer.

Interest Payments to the Federal Government
Pursuant to the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), the state will incur an interest liability to the federal
government. The purpose of CMIA is to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the exchange of funds between
the federal government and the state. The major provisions of CMIA are: (a) federal agencies must make timely fund
disbursements and grant awards to the state; (b) the state must minimize the time between the deposit of federal funds in the
state account and the payout of the funds for program purposes; (c) the state is entitled to interest from the federal government
from the time state funds are paid out for program purposes until federal funds are deposited in the state account; and (d) the
federal government is entitled to interest from the state from the time federal funds are deposited in the state account until the
funds are paid out for program purposes.
The federal assistance programs impacted by the CMIA are those programs that have $282 million or more in federal fund
expenditures. For the majority of these programs, state departments request federal funds in advance of the warrant (i.e.,
check) issuance. State departments use this funding technique because the State Constitution requires that the funds be
deposited before the warrants are issued.
Interest payments to the federal government are due no later than March 31 each year. The payment will be for the interest
liability incurred during the state's prior fiscal year.

Health and Dental Benefits for Annuitants
This program provides funding for health and dental benefit services for retired state employees and their dependents.
The program began on January 1, 1962, with an employer contribution of $5 per month toward the cost of a basic health plan.
Since then, major medical plans, Medicare, and plans supplementing Medicare have been developed. Dental care was added
in 1982.
The 2017-18 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and prior to December 31, 2016,
maintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested
members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment
in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 90
percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer
contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.
The 2017-18 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and after January 1, 2017,
maintains the average 80/80 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871.3 for fully vested
members. Under this formula, the state averages the premiums of the four health benefit plans with the largest state enrollment
in order to calculate the maximum amount the state contributes towards retiree health benefits. The state also contributes 80
percent of this average towards the health benefit costs of each of the retiree's dependents. Vesting schedules and employer
contributions may vary by employee bargaining unit contract.
The retiree is responsible for paying all health benefit plan costs that exceed the state contribution. Premiums are determined
on a calendar-year basis; therefore, the state contribution will vary during the fiscal year. The 2017 monthly contribution
maximums are $707 for a single enrollee, $1,349 for an enrollee and one dependent, and $1,727 for an enrollee and two or
more dependents. The 2018 monthly contribution maximums are $725 for a single enrollee, $1,377 for an enrollee and one
dependent, and $1,766 for an enrollee and two or more dependents. Dental care premiums vary by plan and number of
dependents.
Effective July 1, 2012, funding for health benefits for California State University annuitants is displayed in Organization Code
6645 under Higher Education. This funding was previously budgeted within Organization Code 9650.

Budget Stabilization Account
Proposition 2, approved by voters in November 2014, replaced the Proposition 58 (2004) version of the Budget Stabilization
Account (BSA) to build a stronger "rainy day" reserve while requiring accelerated debt pay down. Proposition 2 strengthened
the reserve by providing more stringent requirements to transfer funds back to the General Fund or suspend deposits to the
BSA, and increasing the reserve limit.
Proposition 2 requires a transfer from the General Fund to the BSA by October 1 of each year, as well as true up transfers
between the General Fund and the BSA for the two preceding fiscal years. In addition to the transfer to the BSA, a calculated
amount is appropriated for supplemental debt payments and other specified long-term liabilities.

PROGRAM AUTHORITY

Control Section 35.50, Budget Act.
Item 9658-011-0001, 2016 Budget Act and 2018 Budget Act.
Item 9658-012-1022, 2018 Budget Act and Government Code Section 16418.8.
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•
Supplemental Transfer to the Rainy Day Fund - The Budget provides a $2.6 billion transfer from the General Fund to the
Budget Deficit Savings Account (BDSA). These funds will support a supplemental transfer to the Budget Stabilization
Account. This transfer is in addition to the current projected amount ($1.7 billion) required by Section 20 of Article XVI of the
California Constitution. In total, the $4.3 billion transfer brings the Rainy Day Fund to $13.8 billion in 2018-19, achieving the
maximum balance allowed by the Constitution for the fiscal year. In the event there is an excess amount in the BDSA after
the 2019-20 May Revision update, the remaining funds shall be divided equally between the BDSA and the Safety Net
Reserve Fund.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
7760 - Proposition 2 requires the Legislature, through the 2029-30 fiscal year, to annually set aside in the BSA for a "rainy day"
50 percent of the sum of 1.5 percent of estimated General Fund revenues and the amount of revenue from capital gains over 8
percent of General Fund tax proceeds that is not required to fund Proposition 98, and use the remaining 50 percent to pay
down debt. Beginning in 2030-31, 100 percent of the above sum would be deposited in the BSA for a "rainy day," reduced by
any amount up to 50 percent that the Legislature appropriates to pay down debt. The maximum balance in the BSA is limited to
10 percent of General Fund proceeds of taxes for the fiscal year. Any amounts in excess of ten percent may only be used for
infrastructure needs.
Proposition 2 includes a true up mechanism for the two preceding years.
The Legislature may suspend or reduce the BSA transfer if the Governor declares a budget emergency. Withdrawal of funds
from the BSA is limited to half of the fund's balance unless funds in the BSA have been returned to the General Fund for
appropriation in the immediately preceding fiscal year.
Proposition 2 also establishes a Proposition 98 reserve whereby spikes in funding will be saved for future years. This will
smooth school spending and minimize future cuts. The Proposition 98 reserve does not change the Proposition 98 minimum
guarantee calculation and transfers will not occur until various operational and economic conditions are met.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
7765 - EQUITY CLAIMS
This program includes all claims approved by the three-member California Victim Compensation Board and the Government
Claims Program under the Department of General Services, and referred to the Legislature in the omnibus claims bills for
payment. The program provides an equitable procedure for the payment of the following categories of claims:
•
Claims for which no appropriation has been made or for which no fund is available, but the settlement of which has been
provided for by statute or constitutional provision.
•
Claims for which the appropriation made or fund designated is exhausted.
•
Claims for which settlement is not otherwise provided for by statute or constitutional provision.
The Government Claims Program was transferred to the Department of General Services from the former California Victim
Compensation and Government Claims Board in July 2016. The California Victim Compensation and Government Claims
Board became the California Victim Compensation Board.

Augmentation for Employee Compensation
This item reflects funding augmentations for state employee compensation. If the Legislature previously appropriated money,
through this budget item, to pay for the economic terms of employee compensation in previous fiscal years, the funding for
those economic terms is included in departments' budgets. When economic terms require funding not yet appropriated by the
Legislature, those funds are included in this budget item.
Additionally, this item sets aside funding for penalties the state may face under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Beginning in
2015, the state became subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility provision of the ACA. This provision requires large
employers to offer health benefits to full-time employees, defined as those who work on average 130 or more hours per month
(or 30 hours per week), and their dependent children. Under this provision, the state may be subject to penalties (Part B
Penalty), which may include part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees that may have been considered full-time for one or
more months, were not offered or did not qualify for health benefits through the state, purchased health coverage from the
Health Insurance Marketplace (known as Covered California), and received a premium tax credit or cost sharing reduction.
The ACA also contains reporting requirements, which require the state to track specified ACA-related employee information on
a monthly basis to identify the employees who meet health eligibility requirements, document whether benefits were offered,
and whether the employee accepted benefits. This data collection is used to report the state's level of ACA compliance to the
Internal Revenue Service on an annual basis. The state may be assessed penalties for inaccurate reporting (Internal Revenue
Code sections 6721 and 6722).

Federal Levy of State Funds
The federal courts periodically issue judgments or "writs of execution" against the State of California requiring the state to make
payments to the federal government. The writs and judgments provide the authority to the federal government to withdraw
funds from the state bank accounts maintained by the State Treasurer's Office at the various state depository banks.
Each year, the Budget Act authorizes the Department of Finance to identify specific appropriations or funds to charge when the
federal government withdraws funds from state bank accounts. When no specific appropriation or fund can be identified, the
withdrawals are charged to the unappropriated General Fund balance.
No levies were paid during the 2016-17 fiscal year and none have been paid through June 15, 2018.

Each year, the Budget Act includes appropriation items in business unit 9840 to be used to supplement department's
appropriations that are insufficient due to unanticipated expenditures or emergency situations. There are three separate
appropriations, one for each fund type - General, special, and non-governmental cost funds. These appropriations are allocated
to other departments by the Department of Finance based upon the determination of need.

Reserve for Liquidation of Encumbrances
For individual department budgets, encumbrances (commitments for the procurement of goods or services which have not yet
been received by the state) are accrued as expenditures by departments at year-end and included in the expenditure totals.
This treatment is in accordance with the budgetary/legal basis of accounting and consistent with individual department budgets.
For the purpose of determining the overall General Fund balance, Government Code Section 13307 requires that
encumbrances should not be counted as a budgetary expenditure until the delivery of the goods and services. Furthermore,
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that encumbrances be reflected as a reserve against the General
Fund balance and not as an expenditure, as in budgetary/legal basis accounting. Government Code Section 13306 and state
policy require compliance with GAAP whenever it is in the best interest of the state. This budget reflects a statewide adjustment
to reduce expenditures on a budgetary/legal basis by the encumbrance amounts to comply with Government Code Section
13307 and GAAP. A reserve of fund balance for encumbrances for this same amount is shown in Summary Schedule 1 for the
General Fund.
COMPUTATION OF ENCUMBRANCE ADJUSTMENT
The State Controller's Office accumulated a preliminary estimated General Fund encumbrance total of $1,164,703,000 from
2016-17 year-end financial statements submitted by state departments. For budgeting purposes, encumbrances are estimated
to be at the same level for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscal years and are assumed to be liquidated (paid) within the next fiscal
year. The Encumbrance Adjustment Table summarizes the methodology and the calculation for the encumbrance adjustment.

Statewide General Administrative Expenditures (Pro Rata)
Central service agencies, such as Department of Finance, the State Treasurer, the State Controller, and Legislature, provide
budgeting, banking, accounting, auditing, payroll, and other services to all state departments. The Pro Rata process apportions
the costs of providing central administrative services to all state departments and funding sources that benefit from the
services. Amounts apportioned to special funds for their fair share of central administrative services costs are transferred from
the special funds to the General Fund and the Central Service Cost Recovery Fund.
Prior to 2016-17, Pro Rata charges to special funds were normally included in the appropriate departmental budgets. This
budget item included Pro Rata costs directly charged to special funds for those cases where appropriate funding was not
provided for in departmental budgets. Effective 2016-17, this budget item includes Pro Rata costs charged directly at the fund
level, rather than each individual appropriation, pursuant to Government Code section 11274.
