6440   University of California 
The University of California (UC) provides instruction in undergraduate, graduate professional, and graduate academic 
programs through the doctoral degree level; research; continuing education for adult learners; and public service. 
The UC was founded in 1868 as a public, state-supported land-grant institution. It was written into the State Constitution of 
1879 as a public trust to be administered by the Regents of the UC. The Board of Regents includes the following 26 members: 
7 ex officio members, 18 members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for 12-year terms, and 1 student 
appointed by the Board. The Governor is President of the Regents. 
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education designates UC as the primary state-supported academic agency for research. The 
UC also serves students at all levels of higher education in California and serves as the public segment primarily responsible 
for awarding doctoral degrees and several professional degrees, including in medicine and law. 
There are ten UC campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa 
Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Nine of these are general campuses that offer undergraduate, graduate, and professional education. 
The San Francisco campus is devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The university operates five teaching hospitals and 
administers more than 800 research centers, institutes, laboratories, and programs. It also oversees one United States 
Department of Energy laboratory and partners with private industry to manage two other Department of Energy laboratories. 
The Regents appoint a university president, who is typically responsible for overall policy development, planning, and resource 
allocation. The ten UC chancellors are responsible for management of the individual campuses. The Regents have delegated 
authority to the Academic Senate, including responsibility for policies on admissions and academic programs.

1 Campus-based fees vary by campus; values shown here are averages on a weighted basis using campus enrollment.  Campus-based fees for 2023-24 have not yet been determined and reflect a five-percent increase 
from 2022-23 levels. Campus-based fees do not include waivable health insurance fees. Waivable health insurance fees average $2,647 for undergraduate students and $5,118 for graduate students in 2022-23.
2 In July 2021, the UC Board of Regents approved a multi-year Tuition Stability Plan that affects Tuition, the Student Services Fee, and Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (NRST). For undergraduate students 
entering fall 2022 and later, the three charges will be assessed on a cohort basis. For graduate students, the three charges will continue to be assessed on a uniform basis. The 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 
amounts for undergraduate students, as shown in the display, reflect student fee levels for the cohort entering fall 2022, fall 2023, and fall 2024, respectively. Undergraduate students who started prior to fall 2022 
will continue to pay 2021-22 rates through 2026-27 for Tuition, the Student Services Fee, and NRST. Their total charges in 2022-23 are $14,137 and $43,891 for resident and nonresident students, respectively; 
their total charges in 2023-24 are $14,198 and $43,952 for resident and nonresident students, respectively; and their projected total charges in 2024-25 are $14,279 and $44,033 for resident and nonresident

schools and community colleges, as well as the public in general. The program includes student academic preparation 
programs and educational partnerships. In these programs, the university works with schools and other partners to help certain 
groups of students meet the standards of academic preparation needed to be successful in higher education and the

veterinary medicine teaching facility at Davis and the San Joaquin Valley; an optometry clinic at Berkeley; and two occupational 
health centers providing services throughout northern (Berkeley, Davis, and San Francisco) and southern (Irvine and Los

campus provisions and (2) from campus provisions to operating programs and subprograms from which expenditures will 
occur. The program may include funds for academic position upgrades, staff reclassifications, price adjustments, employee 
benefit adjustments, debt service, and university endowment income. 
EXTRAMURAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes activities supported by fund sources defined as non-budgeted due to the limited life of the funding 
source.
