Natural 
Resources 
Natural Resources Agency programs protect and 
restore California's diverse natural and cultural 
resources for current and future generations, 
including operating state parks, managing water 
supplies, supporting forest health, encouraging 
clean energy, and preserving fish and wildlife 
habitats, rich farmlands and mineral resources. 
Agency programs also protect the public through 
suppression of wildfires and construction of levees 
in the Central Valley. These programs not only 
contribute to the state's unique quality of life, but 
also are critical to sustaining a vibrant economy. 
3100   Exposition Park 
The Science Center, the Office of Exposition Park Management and the California African American Museum (CAAM), are 
located in Exposition Park, a 160-acre tract in south Los Angeles, which is owned by the state. For budget purposes, these 
three departments are collectively known as Exposition Park. 
The mission of the Science Center is to stimulate curiosity and inspire science related learning. The Office of Exposition Park 
Management provides long-term leadership in the development and implementation of park usage policy and day-to-day 
management, operation and promotion of the park for its tenants and the public. The mission of CAAM is to research, collect, 
preserve and interpret for public enrichment, the history, art and culture of African Americans with a multi-layered focus that is 
global, national, and local with special emphasis on California and the western United States.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2300 - CALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER 
 
Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the California Science Center represents one of California's premier educational and 
family destinations. Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center develops 
and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 
Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological 
processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering, 
communications, and transportation, on land and in space. In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its temporary 
home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center - its 
permanent home - is completed. 
In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries. The 
Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and 
other educators. The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school. As a 
Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles. The 
school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 
The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those 
traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering. The Science Center receives significant funding 
support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.

3125   California Tahoe Conservancy 
The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the extraordinary natural and 
recreational resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin (Basin). The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and 
implementing programs that acquire environmentally sensitive land, provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention and 
watershed restoration, and improve stream environments, wildlife habitats, forest health, and water quality. The Conservancy 
also balances these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally 
sound manner by acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 
The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) which is intended to 
restore and protect the Basin's natural resources.  The EIP leverages funding from the states of California and Nevada, the 
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and various private entities for projects needed 
to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. 
Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program 
to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 
The Conservancy owns and manages nearly 4,700 parcels totaling more than 6,500 acres, including thousands of quarter-acre 
lots within the Basin’s urban areas. These parcels provide open space, water quality and recreational benefits, and have 
significantly reduced the potential level of development in the Basin. The Conservancy manages its lands for multiple benefits 
and inspects each parcel once every two years to monitor forest health and to identify maintenance needs and encroachments. 
Maintaining healthy forests in urban areas to help protect life and property constitutes another fundamental role of the 
Conservancy’s land management program. The Conservancy also manages 11 properties with recreational amenities, 
including six beaches that provide public access to Lake Tahoe. 
The Conservancy and its partners are also increasingly shifting to large landscape, multi-jurisdictional, multiple-benefit projects 
to more rapidly and comprehensively achieve restoration goals in the Basin. Working at a landscape scale makes it easier for 
the Conservancy and its partners to integrate the planning for and management of multiple values and resources across 
jurisdictions. The Conservancy plans to continue working with a wide variety of partners to restore the health and resilience of

the Basin’s forests and watersheds, with the aim of also increasing the pace and scale of restoration. This includes improving 
forest diversity, protecting wildlife, applying beneficial fire, clearing meadows of encroaching trees, reducing streambank 
erosion, reconnecting floodplains, and treating storm water. This work will enhance the ability of these lands to respond to 
wildfire, drought, insects, and climate change. This evolution in the Conservancy’s approach to planning also aligns it with 
national and statewide trends toward restoring landscape resilience. 
The Conservancy also works closely with local governments to meet its mission by providing grants for acquisitions and site 
improvements such as building roadside and storm drainage facilities and sediment basins, building bike trails, and creating 
public gathering spaces and improving public access to the Lake. 
2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 
This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing 
facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide 
variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and watersheds 
such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality. 
In addition, the program is helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve environmental benefits by promoting 
urban in-fill development in the Basin. These efforts include selling, leasing, or exchanging non-environmentally sensitive 
Conservancy lands and associated development rights to support revitalization efforts consistent with local area plans and town 
center objectives.  Property exchanges and the proceeds from the sale or leasing of property are then used to (1) acquire other 
environmentally sensitive lands or (2) fund conservation and other projects that support the Conservancy in fulfilling its mission.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California Tahoe Conservancy manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife habitat, 
watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy is a primary implementer 
of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake Tahoe Basin - a 
1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local 
governments, and various private entities. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects, 
modifications in the scope of identified projects, and new projects.

3340   California Conservation Corps 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires, 
floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at 
public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become 
strong workers and citizens. 
In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that 
are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities. 
Because the CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on the CCC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 9 residential and 17 non-residential 
facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training, 
and educational opportunities to young men and women. The facilities are also critical in the CCC assisting federal, state and 
local agencies, as well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources. 
The CCC residential facilities house 80-100 corpsmembers and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people together from 
across the state, increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential centers range in size 
from 30-60 corpsmembers and allow young people with families to live at home and report to work.

3480   Department of Conservation - Continued
NATURAL RESOURCES
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 
This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 
tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety and 
the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by federal, 
state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed decisions about 
land use, seismic safety, and mineral development. 
2425 - OIL, GAS, AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES 
This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to protect the 
environment, prevent pollution, and ensure public safety. The state is fully reimbursed for program expenditures by annual 
assessments and fees on the respective industries. Approximately 450 companies operate over 88,000 wells in California for 
the production of oil, natural gas, and geothermal resources. 
2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION 
This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. Under the Land Conservation 
Act, landowners who agree to keep their property undeveloped for at least ten years receive lower property tax assessments. 
The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts for the 
acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development rights, and therefore development 
pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program within the Land Resource Protection 
Program develops maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land protection to 
assist in local land use decisions. 
2435 - MINE RECLAMATION 
This program regulates active surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the 
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to 
reclaim mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned 
mines and remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety. 
2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD 
The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of 
mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The Department's California Geological Survey and the Office of Mine 
Reclamation provide the engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for the reports, plans, and maps which the 
Board approves. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notices of violations 
or orders to comply, and disputes with local lead agencies.

3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the 
property and resources of California. 
CAL FIRE provides all hazard emergency - fire, medical, rescue and disaster - response to the public and provides leadership 
in the protection of life, property and natural resources. 
CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety 
programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information & education; resource protection; and emergency response. 
CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing 
diverse yet complementary efforts including: training California's fire service professionals; public education and prevention 
awareness; responsible stewardship of our natural resources; and natural resource and emergency management. 
CAL FIRE's highly trained professionals and leaders cultivate mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels 
of government and the private sector to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate 
emergencies in the urban, rural, and wild land areas of California. 
CAL FIRE promotes a culture of innovation, accountability, integrity, diversity, planning, workplace safety, and teamwork to 
foster an efficient and effective organizational environment. 
Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Increasing Fire Prevention—$224.3 million from various funds to (1) complete more fuel reduction projects through the 
operation of prescribed fire crews and grants for forest health projects; (2) implement the recently enacted wildfire prevention 
and recovery legislative package, which streamlines regulatory barriers for fuel reduction projects; (3) support the Board of 
Forestry and Fire Protection in certifying the Programmatic Environmental Impact Report for the California Vegetation 
Treatment Program; (4) enhance land use plannning and wildfire risk reduction efforts in the wildland urban interface; and 
(5) dispose of illegal and dangerous fireworks. 
• Expanding Firefighting Surge Capacity—$64.4 million General Fund to enhance CAL FIRE's fire protection capabilities, 
including resources to (1) add 13 new year-round fire engines that will be located in areas of the state with the highest fire 
risk, (2) expand heavy fire equipment operator staffing to support CAL FIRE’s bulldozer operations during emergency wildfire 
events, (3) accelerate the replacement of fire engines and other mobile equipment to address increased wear and tear on 
CAL FIRE’s vehicles resulting from the longer fire season, and (4) operate five additional CAL FIRE/California Conservation 
Corps fire crews. 
• Enhancing Aviation Resources—$127.2 million General Fund to add aircraft with increased tactical capabilities to 
CAL FIRE’s aviation fleet to meet the challenges associated with more severe wildfire activity. Specifically, the Budget 
includes $17.7 million General Fund for the first year of operating the large air tankers that will be transferred from the 
U.S. Air Force. Federal legislation authorized the transfer of seven C-130 air tankers to CAL FIRE, and the Budget assumes 
that one to two planes will be transferred each year beginning in 2019-20. The Budget also includes $109.5 million

General Fund to continue the replacement of CAL FIRE's Vietnam War-era helicopters with new state-of-the art helicopters. 
• Supporting our Emergency Responders—$6.6 million from various funds to expand CAL FIRE’s health and wellness 
program and to provide medical and psychological services, as well as peer support, to firefighters. Catastrophic wildfires are 
creating an environment where first responders are working longer hours and days to mitigate these incidents, while also 
focusing on evacuations in the early hours of fires to get citizens safely out of harm’s way. Personnel are CAL FIRE’s most 
valuable asset, and maintaining their long-term health and well-being allows them to be ready for the next emergency. 
• Improving Use of Technology—$24.7 million General Fund to enable CAL FIRE to (1) procure innovation solutions to combat 
the state's wildfire crisis, consistent with Executive Order N-04-19, by utilizing a modified procurement process referred to as 
the Innovation Procurement Sprint through which CAL FIRE will work collaboratively with vendors to identify, develop, and 
deploy new and innovative solutions; (2) hire dedicated staff to review data gathered via remote sensing technology, 
situational awareness software, and satellite imagery, which will support CAL FIRE’s incident command 
decision-making; and (3) operate 100 additional fire detection cameras that will be linked into the existing command centers 
to provide additional data on conditions.

2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal is responsible for the statewide protection of life and property through the development 
and application of fire protection engineering, education and enforcement. 
2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) includes the following activities: 
• Code Development and Analysis: Objectives include the development and adoption of codes relating to fire/life safety used 
statewide by local fire and building authorities. The Code Development and Analysis Division fosters, promotes and develops 
ways and means of protecting life and property against fire in many ways, including the adoption and implementation of 
regulations for statewide application. This division prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations and building standards 
for review and adoption into the California Code of Regulations, Titles 19 and 24. The division assists with the application of 
state laws, regulations, and code enforcement relating by a city, county, fire departments or fire districts, and building 
departments. This division also reviews all of California's regulations relating to fire and life safety for relevancy, necessity, 
conflict, duplication and/or overlap. 
• Fire and Life Safety: This program is the main entity within the department for the application of laws and regulations related 
to fire prevention and life safety. This is achieved through code compliance inspections of new and existing buildings and 
plan review and construction inspections of state-owned and state-occupied projects. The OSFM is responsible for fire & life 
safety in over 45,000 state-owned and state-occupied facilities, which include: state prisons, conservation camps, community 
correctional facilities, state mental hospitals, state developmental centers, California State University and University of 
California campuses, and California Agricultural Districts. 
• Fire Engineering and Investigations: This division administers licensing programs and provides services for product 
evaluation, certifications and listings. This division also oversees the Arson and Bomb Unit, which has the responsibility to 
dispose seized illegal fireworks and conduct fire/explosion investigations and licensing enforcement. The division is 
responsible for 11 statewide programs, which include the Building Materials Listing; Portable Fire Extinguishers; Flame 
Retardant Chemicals and Fabrics; Vapor Recovery; Automatic Fire Extinguishing Systems; Fire Safe Cigarettes; Licensing 
Enforcement and Inspection; Lab Accreditation; Fireworks; and Motion Picture and Entertainment, Arson and Bomb 
Investigation and Fireworks Disposal. This division's primary functions are licensing, product approval, fire/explosion 
investigations and licensing enforcement. 
• Pipeline Safety: This program ensures the safe construction, operation and maintenance of approximately 6,500 miles of 
intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines that transport crude oil, refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc.) and Highly 
Volatile Liquids (HVL) throughout California including, but not limited to, populated urban areas, ecologically sensitive areas 
and other high consequence areas. Pipelines that fall under the Pipeline Safety Division authority are pipelines that transport 
hazardous liquids between facilities, such as offshore platforms, production fields, refineries, storage terminals and marine 
terminals. OSFM regulated pipelines do not include those within production fields, marine terminals or refineries. 
• State Fire Training: This program administers the California Fire Service Training and Education System and the Fire Service 
Training and Education Program for federal, state and local firefighters. The program oversees a California Fire Academy 
System for over 50 training academies that represent a partnership with the fire departments, community colleges and the 
OSFM. State Fire Training administers a professional certification system for firefighters and chief officers and receives 
program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services. 
2461019 - California Underground Facilities Safe Excavation Board: 
Also called the “Dig Safe Board,” created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661), works on issues related to 
the State's "Call Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators and buried infrastructure owners to coordinate to prevent 
infrastructure damage and unsafe outcomes. The Dig Safe Board is charged with coordinating the state’s safe excavation 
outreach and education efforts, developing safe excavation standards, investigating accidents and working with partner state 
agencies to enforce the “Call Before You Dig” law. 
2465 - FIRE PROTECTION 
CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property and natural resources within social, political and economic 
constraints. The objective is to quickly and aggressively attack all fires in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct 
protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial attack and 
follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires within the first 
burning period. 
2465010 - Fire Prevention: 
This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression 
cost recovery and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials and procedures to 
mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to be

done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of fire fighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire fighters 
and damage to the environment. 
2465019 - Fire Control: 
The objective of this program is to detect, respond and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility Area. 
The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 
10 acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews, 
bulldozers, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. 
2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection: 
CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state and federal agencies throughout California 
through the administration of over 100 cooperative government agreements. Additionally, there are six long standing 
agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department. 
2465037 - Conservation Camps: 
CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Operations and Juvenile 
Justice, operates 39 conservation camps throughout the state that house 196 fire crews. CAL FIRE also operates three Fire 
Centers with the California Conservation Corps (CCC) throughout the state that house seven fire crews. These crews provide 
one of the primary labor forces for firefighting, emergency response, and conservation related work projects. 
2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 
CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope 
with a wildland fire within the initial attack period. Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was 
incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of 
this cost through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes. 
2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands and urban forests provide multiple human, climate and 
environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to 
these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting, 
coordination of climate related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial landowners, operation of 
state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects and administration of federal 
forestry assistance programs. 
2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement: 
The objective of this program is to improve forest lands and urban forests. Activities include the detection, evaluation and 
control of forest pests; growing and selling tree seedlings for reforestation, carbon sequestration, and soil erosion control; 
maintenance of a native conifer seed bank; advice and assistance to non-industrial forest landowners on management of 
forests and improved harvesting and conservation practices; research on and demonstration of sustainable forestry in state 
forests; implementation of the California Forest Improvement Act of 1978; technical assistance and grants to foster the 
environmental, social, and economic benefits of urban forests consistent with the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978; and 
purchase and monitoring of working forest conservation easements per the California Forest Legacy Act of 2008. In the area of 
vegetation management, assistance is provided to public and private landowners to achieve land use objectives by reducing 
damage from wildland fires, increase wildlife habitat, increase productivity of forest and rangelands, improve water yields and 
air quality, reduce carbon emissions from wildland fires, increase firefighter safety, and maintain desirable ecosystems. 
CAL FIRE cooperates with federal, state and local agencies, local organizations, and private property owners to develop and 
achieve land use objectives. Activities include removal, rearrangement, conversion, or improvement of vegetation using various 
treatment measures such as prescribed fire and mechanical, manual, and biological methods. The Environmental Protection 
Program provides in-house expertise and oversight of the Department's compliance with the California Environmental Quality 
Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws and regulations applicable to departmental actions. 
2470019 - Forest Practice Regulations: 
The objective of this program is to maximize sustained production of high-quality timber products while protecting soil, water, 
wildlife, recreation and other values associated with forest land. Forest Practice activities include the review and permitting of 
commercial timber harvesting operations on nonfederal timberlands, enforcing state forest practice laws and regulations, and 
monitoring compliance and the effects of timber operations on forest productivity, water quality, watersheds, soils, botanical 
resources, wildlife, fisheries, greenhouse gases and other environmentally sensitive resources. The Program is also 
responsible for issuing licenses to timber operators (LTOs), providing LTO training and education, and assisting the Board of 
Equalization-Timber Tax Division in their administration of taxes on timber and timberland. Forest Practice Program staff also 
assist the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, and facilitate and participate in monitoring the effectiveness of the Board's 
forest practice regulations.

3560   State Lands Commission 
The California State Lands Commission provides the people of California with effective stewardship of the lands, waterways, 
and resources entrusted to its care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development, and 
the promotion of public access. Diligent execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted 
in the generation of over $11.6 billion in revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy those lands and 
resources. 
Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands 
Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing California's sovereign public trust lands and resources, 
which the state received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands subsequently conveyed to the 
state by the federal government (commonly known as "school" lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands 
legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage development and use of the state's 
tidelands, consistent with the public trust doctrine, and typically require grantees to reinvest revenues produced from the 
granted lands back into the trust. 
Public trust or "sovereign" lands include the beds of all natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and 
lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the mean high 
tide line seaward to the three-mile offshore limit and totaling over four and one-half million acres. In addition to sovereign lands, 
the Commission manages "school" lands, which were granted to California by the federal government under the Act of March 
3, 1853 (10 Stat. 244) for the purpose of supporting public education in California. School lands include the 16th and 36th 
sections of each township (with the exception of lands already reserved for public use or previously taken by private claims) 
and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, 
only about 458,843 acres remain in state ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The 
Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT 
The California State Lands Commission oversees efficient and safe development of mineral resources that are located on state 
lands. The State also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oils fields, and as such, the Commission participates 
in the safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas, 
geothermal resources and other minerals; collect revenues generated consistent with the best interests of the state; and ensure 
that public safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development of these 
resources through engineering review, marine facility inspections, and safety audits. The Commission also adopts regulations 
for the prevention of oil spills, the safe operation of offshore facilities and program and financial audits to ensure the state 
receives fair value for the development of its resources. 
2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT 
The California State Lands Commission manages all ungranted state sovereign lands consistent with the common law public 
trust doctrine and prudent land use and management practices. The Commission issues leases and permits for the use and 
occupation of public trust lands under its jurisdiction based upon environmental, economic, health, safety and public benefit 
considerations. The program also manages all state school lands to ensure the greatest economic return to the California State 
Teachers' Retirement System. The Commission also oversees the administration of public trust lands legislatively granted to 
local jurisdictions to manage on behalf of the State, including the major ports in the State.

2570 - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION 
The California State Lands Commission adopts rules, regulations, and guidelines for marine oil terminals within California, 
providing the best achievable protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Commission's Marine 
Environmental Protection Program monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, inspects all marine facilities, and reviews 
and approves all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification programs. The Program also administers 
Chapter 31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit for purpose. In addition, the Marine 
Environmental Protection Program implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of non-
indigenous species into California waters through vessel mediated vectors. The program funds and conducts scientific 
research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing 
vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions. 
9900100 - EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATION 
The Executive and Administration program provides management, policy direction and administrative support to the line 
programs of the Commission.

3600   Department of Fish and Wildlife 
The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the 
habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public. 
This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to ensure the survival of all species and 
natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational, 
commercial, scientific, and educational uses. 
Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2590 - BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROGRAM 
This program encourages the preservation, conservation, maintenance, and restoration of wildlife resources, including the 
Ecosystem Restoration Program, under the jurisdiction and influence of the state. Activities involve the conservation, protection 
and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat to ensure maintenance of biologically sustainable populations of 
those species. 
2595 - HUNTING, FISHING, AND PUBLIC USE PROGRAM 
This program facilitates diverse and sustainable hunting, fishing (recreational and commercial), trapping, and other public uses 
and associated economic benefits to the state by conserving and managing game species. Activities include collection and 
assessment of information on the distribution and abundance of game fish and wildlife to determine appropriate regulations 
(bag limits, gear restrictions, etc.) and to monitor the effects of those regulations. 
2600 - MANAGEMENT OF DEPARTMENT LANDS AND FACILITIES PROGRAM 
This program manages Department-owned or leased lands and facilities, including hatcheries, wildlife areas, ecological 
reserves, fish and wildlife laboratories, and public access areas, to contribute to the conservation, protection, and management 
of fish and wildlife. 
2605 - ENFORCEMENT 
This program serves the public through law enforcement, public safety and hunter education. Law enforcement promotes 
compliance with laws and regulations protecting fish and wildlife resources; investigates habitat destruction, pollution incidents 
and illegal commercialization of wildlife. Wardens also serve the public through general law enforcement, mutual aid and 
homeland security. 
2610 - COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH PROGRAM 
This program serves the public through resource conservation education and use activities in the classroom and on public and 
private lands, community and stakeholder outreach, and the delivery of information and data using a variety of methods 
including publications, presentations, web applications and media relations. 
2615 - SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM 
This program prevents damage, minimizes environmental impacts, restores, and rehabilitates California's fish and wildlife 
populations and their habitats from the harmful effects of oil and other deleterious material spills in marine waters and inland 
habitats. 
2620 - FISH AND GAME COMMISSION 
The California Fish and Game Commission ensures the long term sustainability of California's fish and wildlife resources by 
guiding the ongoing scientific evaluation and assessment of California's fish and wildlife resources; setting California's fish and 
wildlife resource management policies and ensuring these are implemented by the Department of Fish and Wildlife; 
establishing appropriate fish and wildlife resource management rules and regulations; and building active fish and wildlife 
resource management partnerships with individual landowners, the public and interest groups, and federal, state and local 
resource management agencies.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages 742 properties statewide, comprising more than 1 million acres (approximately 
679,000 acres of state-owned land and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the Department. Several state 
agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management responsibilities for these properties 
are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department control continues to increase. The 
properties managed by the Department include: 111 wildlife areas, 136 ecological reserves, 138 public access areas, and 21 
fish hatcheries.

3720   California Coastal Commission 
The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed equally by the Governor, the Senate Rules 
Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the 
California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and 
recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources, 
and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. New development in the coastal zone requires 
a coastal permit either from local government or the Commission. Local governments are required to prepare a local coastal 
program (LCP) for the coastal zone portion of their jurisdiction. After an LCP has been reviewed and approved by the 
Commission as being consistent with the Coastal Act, the Commission's regulatory authority over most types of new 
development is delegated to the local government, subject to limited appeals to the Commission. The Commission also is 
designated the principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone 
Management Act in California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal 
development projects, and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be 
subject to state control.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2730 - COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
The objectives of the Coastal Management Program are to implement coastal resources conservation through planning and 
regulation. Activities include: 
• Reviewing and approval of local coastal programs (LCPs), port master plans, university long-range development plans, and 
any amendments to such plans, for consistency with the Coastal Act. 
• Reviewing coastal development permit applications for new development in areas without a certified LCP, areas of 
permanently retained jurisdiction (e.g., tidelands, submerged lands, and public trust lands) and limited categories of local 
coastal development permit actions that can be appealed to the Commission. 
• Monitoring and enforcement of coastal development permits. 
• Reviewing federal activities for consistency with the Coastal Act. 
• Protecting and expanding opportunities for public coastal access and recreation. 
• Implementing a coastal water quality protection program. 
• Providing technical information and assistance to support effective coastal management. 
• Implementing a coastal and ocean resource public education program. 
2735 - COASTAL ENERGY PROGRAM 
The Coastal Energy Program addresses coastal energy issues including, but not limited to, offshore oil and gas development, 
electricity generating power plant expansion and development, and siting and development of liquefied natural gas facilities. 
(Note: Program 2735 will be consolidated into Program 2730 beginning Fiscal Year 2019-20.)

3790   Department of Parks and Recreation 
The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and 
education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most 
valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and 
future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to the 
major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural 
resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park 
visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and 
water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, 
jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds, 
plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by providing 
financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies. 
Because Parks' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Parks has a capital outlay program to support this need. 
For the specifics on Parks' capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

3820   San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission 
The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional 
authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance San Francisco Bay and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive use 
for this and future generations. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan and relies on it, the 
McAteer-Petris Act, and other regulatory authority to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The Commission 
issues permits for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and within salt ponds and 
certain managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. 
By state statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management Act's program for the Bay 
and exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The Commission leads the ongoing multi-
agency regional effort to address the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on the Bay and its environs. Funding for 
these efforts to address climate change is derived mainly from federal grants and other agreements, contracts, and 
reimbursements.

3845   San Diego River Conservancy 
The mission of the San Diego River Conservancy is to achieve the goals of the San Diego River Conservancy Act by 
implementing five six major programs: Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Preserve Natural/Cultural Resources, 
Water Quality and Natural Flood Conveyance, Organizational Capacity and Reach, and the San Diego Rivers Watershed 
Consortium. This mission will be accomplished in part by building, with our partners, a San Diego River Park and hiking trail 
stretching from the headwaters in Julian to the Pacific Ocean and creating advisory panels to assist in restoring and enhancing 
three nearby rivers from their headlands to the Pacific Ocean - the Otay River, Sweetwater River and Tijuana River. These 
programs foster collaboration among governments and nonprofit organizations, and leverage grant funding to achieve an array 
of conservation objectives.

3860   Department of Water Resources 
The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department 
evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs and explores future potential solutions to meet ever-growing 
needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also works to 
prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of water and its 
efficient use. 
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 
The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's water 
resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the public to 
consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future water 
conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources including water 
supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water uses. The Plan 
identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as conservation, 
recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem restoration, 
groundwater, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected 
catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare 
integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure 
sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban development, 
protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water Element for their 
General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help local agencies and 
tribal governments improve coordination between water and land use planning. 
3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 
The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes), 21 
pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals, 
pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. 
The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities which provide 
water to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County. 
The California WaterFix Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability in a safe, 
timely, and cost-effective manner. This includes implementation of the California WaterFix, project specific environmental 
commitments, and compliance with the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement and other state and 
federal regulations and permits. 
3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE 
This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures proper 
construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for the construction. Activities include 
assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage unwise use 
of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control facilities,

coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and inspection in 
cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and rights-of-way 
for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic inspection and 
reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and coordination activities 
associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered under this program. The 
program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies with regard to dam safety. 
3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD 
The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC), 
designated floodways and regulated streams in the Central Valley. The Board regulates encroachments on the system by 
issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that 
protect the valley's people and property. The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Drainage District. The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on large 
joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies that operate 
and maintain the SPFC. The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public forum for 
stakeholders. 
3255 - SERVICES 
This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning, 
development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory; 
information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies. 
3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING 
For a limited period of time, this program purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. Beginning 
January 1, 2003, the utility companies resumed responsibility for purchasing power from the spot market. The utilities, however, 
continued to receive power from the Department's long-term energy contracts with energy suppliers, under which the 
Department retains legal and financial responsibility. All energy contracts signed by the Department have now expired or were 
terminated. However, litigation continues against some of the counterparties to these contracts. Additionally, the Department 
retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering $3.213 billion in revenue bonds issued to repay the General Fund 
for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and funding of reserve accounts necessary to maintain an 
investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control 
system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage 
facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 21 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 
miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated 
farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate 
reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the 
Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank 
protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams, weirs, 
pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more flood 
protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

3885   Delta Stewardship Council 
Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board, is 
to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and 
enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects and 
enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. In 2013, the Council adopted 
a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to the Delta. 
Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and the other 
relevant agencies. The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta Independent 
Science Board. The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific information to 
inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
