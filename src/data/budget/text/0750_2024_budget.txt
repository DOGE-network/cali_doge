0750   Office of the Lieutenant Governor 
Under California's Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor serves as Acting Governor whenever the Governor is absent from the 
state, and automatically becomes Governor if a vacancy occurs in the Office of Governor. The Lieutenant Governor is also 
President of the Senate and votes in case of a tie. 
The Lieutenant Governor serves as a voting member of the Board of Regents of the University of California, the Board of 
Trustees of the California State University system, and the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges system. 
The Lieutenant Governor also sits on the Calbright College Board of Trustees. 
The Lieutenant Governor also serves on, and rotates with the State Controller, as chair of the three-member State Lands 
Commission, which oversees the control and leasing of millions of acres of state-owned land, including offshore oil resources, 
as well as use and permitting for all navigable waterways in California. The Commission also manages state land-use planning 
and revenues, and related interstate issues. During alternate years, when the Lieutenant Governor serves as Chairperson of 
the State Lands Commission, the Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of the Ocean Protection Council and as a 
non-voting member of the California Coastal Commission. 
In addition, under state statutes, the Lieutenant Governor chairs the California Commission for Economic Development, which 
provides support and guidance to the Governor, Legislature, and private sector regarding the development of California's 
economy.
