Legislative,
Judicial, and
Executive
Governmental bodies classified under the
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive section of the
Governor's Budget are either established as
independent entities under the California
Constitution, or are departments with a
recognized need to operate outside of the
administrative oversight and control of an agency
secretary. Constitutionally-established bodies
include the Legislature, Judicial Branch,
Governor's Office, and constitutional officers.
This section also includes such independent
entities as the Inspector General and the
California State Lottery.

0150    Contributions to the Legislators' Retirement System
 
Established in 1947, the Legislators' Retirement System provides retirement and death benefits for legislators, constitutional
officers, and legislative statutory officers. 
 
The Legislators' Retirement System is funded through contributions from the state, members of the system, and investment
earnings.  Between 2000-01 and 2011-12, the Legislators' Retirement System was super-funded and neither the state nor
members were required to contribute. Beginning in 2012-13, contributions resumed for the state and members. 
 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) administers the Legislators' Retirement System on behalf
of its members. Retirement benefits paid are based upon age, years of service, and final compensation. Benefits for death,
disability, and surviving dependents of deceased members are also provided under specific conditions. 
 
Proposition 140, approved by voters in 1990, closed the Legislators' Retirement System to all new legislators after
November 6, 1990. 
 
Effective January 1, 2013, the Legislators' Retirement System was closed to all new members by the California Public
Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes of 2012 (AB 340). New constitutional officers, statutory
officers, Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Insurance Commissioner retain optional membership rights in CalPERS.

0160    Legislative Counsel Bureau
 
The Legislative Counsel Bureau (Bureau) provides legal assistance to the two houses of the Legislature, and their members
and committees, by resolving a large volume of complex legal problems arising in connection with the legislative process.
The legal services furnished include rendering opinions, drafting bills, counseling, attending as counsel meetings of
legislative committees, and representing the Legislature in litigation.  The attorney-client relationship is maintained and all
work is confidential. 
 
In addition, the Bureau prepares and provides necessary indices and appropriate tables necessary to identify legislative
measures and compiles and indexes statutes and codes. 
 
The Bureau operates the Legislative Data Center, which provides information technology services in support of the
legislative information system and the processing of legislative measures. 
 
Pursuant to Chapter 46 of the Statutes of 2012, the California Commission on Uniform State Laws was transferred into the
Legislative Counsel Bureau.  The California Commission on Uniform State Laws presents to the Legislature uniform laws
recommended by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and then promotes passage of these
uniform acts.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
0250    Judicial Branch
 
Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power
of the state at the appellate level.  Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial
system.  Chapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person
financially unable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. 
 
The Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent
funding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of operation of the trial
courts was implemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs.
This implementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95
level.  The county contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations.  Fine and
penalty revenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute.  Each county makes quarterly
payments to the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95,
as adjusted by amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04.  The Trial
Court Facilities Act of 2002 (Chapter 1082, Statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be
transferred from the counties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9,
Statutes of 2008. The Trial Court Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, which went into effect
on January 1, 2003.  These revenues are deposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of
funding the construction and maintenance of court facilities throughout the state.  Counties contribute revenues for the
ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities based upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. 
 
The mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law
consistently, impartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California
and the United States, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. 
 
Because the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Judicial Branch's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

5/ Reflects half of total funding ($21.4 million). Allocation pending updated workload metrics from the courts related to 2016-17.
6/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. Funds either disbursed on behalf of trial courts, for statewide programs, for judges compensation, or to non-court entities, and as a result are not included in the superior courts’ state 
funding in Section 1.
7/ See the "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" display for more detail. These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and 
Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total 
expenditures displayed for "State Trial Court Funding Total".
8/ For the prior year, recognizes that the revenues courts report individually as received or to be received from the state will not be equal to the "State Trial Court Funding" expenditure amount reported at the state level due to timing and accounting differences.  For the current 
year, this category reflects either differences in local versus state revenue projections, pending court budgets, or unallocated appropriation.
1/ Reflects the 2015-16 4th quarter Quarterly Financial Statement information submitted by the superior courts. A detailed breakdown of this data can be found in the Report of Trial Court Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance Constraints for Fiscal Year 2015-16. Non-state 
funding includes local fees and non-fee revenue, enhanced collections and other reimbursements, grants from non-state entities, etc.
2/ Reflects the filled full-time equivalent positions reported on the Schedule 7As submitted by the superior courts. Does not include judges, who are constitutional officers and not court employees.
3/ Reflects the budgets of all 57 superior courts based on courts' 2016-17 Schedule 1 submissions as of November 28, 2016.
4/ Reflects pending allocations from the Judicial Council. Courts may have budgeted for some of these funds in Section 1 above in anticipation of their allocation.

5/ For the TCTF, expenses are the annual premiums for 57 participating trial courts from their allocations and for superior court judges from the appropriation for the Compensation of Superior Court Judges that are transferred to the JBWCF.  For 
the JBWCF, these expenses reflect payments of trial court employee and judge related workers' compensation claims from the JBWCF less the amount transferred from the TCTF.
1/ Includes all Program 0150 "State Trial Court Funding" as well as Program 0140019 "Trial Court Operations" expenses from all funds, including the Trial Court Trust Fund (TCTF), State Trial Court Improvement and Modernization Fund (IMF), 
General Fund (GF), and Judicial Branch Workers' Compensation Fund (JBWCF).  The expenses do not necessarily represent all expenses as those programs have a state operations component (e.g., Equal Access Fund) and/or a distribution that is 
made directly to courts (e.g., court-appointed dependency counsel).
2/ These expenses are funded by the trial courts opting to participate in those programs from their "State Funding" revenue distribution amounts reported in Section 1 of the "State and Non-State Trial Court Funding, Expenditures, and Positions" 
display. Because the funding for these expenses is already included in Section 1, they are subtracted from the total "State Trial Court Funding Not Distributed to the Trial Courts" amount used to calculate the total expenditures displayed for "State 
Trial Court Funding Total". 
4/ Reflects actual or estimated payments made directly to court-appointed dependency counsel from the TCTF on behalf of superior courts participating in the Dependency Representation, Administration, Funding, and Training (DRAFT) Program. 
Courts not participating in the DRAFT program are reimbursed up to a maximum amount from the TCTF for payments to court-appointed dependency counsel.
3/ This reflects judges' compensation paid excluding any amounts related to the reimbursement of courts for payments of judges' compensation as these amounts are already included in the courts' "State Funding" revenue amounts reported in the 
Trial Court Information section ($113.5 million in 2015-16 and $119.1 million in 2016-17). Judges from the Los Angeles, Riverside, and Ventura County Superior Courts are compensated locally and the court/county is reimbursed by the TCTF. In 
addition, 26 courts in 2015-16 and 25 courts in 2016-17 participate in the local salary reimbursement program in which a small portion of the judges' salary is paid locally and reimbursed by the TCTF.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0130 - SUPREME COURT 
 
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the California judicial system.  Its decisions are binding on all other California
state courts.  The Chief Justice of California and the six Associate Justices entertain petitions seeking review of decisions
from the Courts of Appeal, original petitions for extraordinary relief (such as writs of mandate or habeas corpus), and
recommendations for discipline of judicial officers and attorneys.  The Court grants review and issues opinions in order to
settle legal questions of statewide importance.  In addition, under the California Constitution, all death penalty judgments are
appealed directly to the Supreme Court. 
 
0135 - COURTS OF APPEAL 
 
Established by a constitutional amendment in 1904, the Courts of Appeal are California's intermediate courts of review.  The
six District Courts of Appeal hear appeals and original proceedings at nine different locations around the state.  Cases
before the Courts of Appeal involve every area of civil and criminal law. 
 
0140 - JUDICIAL COUNCIL 
 
The Judicial Council of California is the constitutional policy-making body for the state judiciary.  The Council consists of 21
voting members and 11 advisory members; the Chief Justice of California serves as chair.  The Judicial Council staff serve
as the administrative arm of the Council.  Staff provide policy support to the Council, administrative accountability in the
operation of the courts as specified by law, strategic planning for capital outlay, design, and construction of court facilities;
and administrative support for courts in areas such as budget, fiscal services, coordination of the assignment of retired
judges, technology, education, legal advice and services, human resources, legislative advocacy, and research. 
 
Consistent with the judiciary's mission, the Judicial Council is guided by the following principles: 
 
To make decisions in the best interests of the public and the court system as a whole.
To conduct the Council's business based on an underlying commitment to equal and timely justice and public access to
an independent forum for the resolution of disputes.
To provide leadership in the administration of justice by planning and advocating for policies and resources that are
necessary for courts to fulfill their mission.
To ensure the continued development of an accessible, independent court system through planning, research, and
evaluation programs, and through the use of modern management approaches and technological developments.
To provide leadership in the administration of justice by establishing broad and consistent policies for the operation of the
courts and appropriate uniform statewide rules and forms.
To promote a competent, responsive, and ethical judiciary and staff through a comprehensive program of judicial
education and training for court employees.
To contribute to the public's understanding of the judicial process through a continuing program of public education.
To provide assistance to the courts in developing action plans that are consistent with the Council's Strategic Plan and
that address local needs and priorities.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Judicial Council facilities consist of the offices of its staff, the Supreme Court, the Courts of Appeal, the Habeas Corpus
Resource Center, the Commission on Judicial Performance, and all Trial Courts statewide. The Supreme Court is located in
the Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco (98,000 square feet) and the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los Angeles (7,600
sf). The Courts of Appeal are organized into six districts, operate in nine different locations, and consist of approximately
508,000 sf. The Trial Courts are located in 58 counties statewide consisting of more than 500 buildings and 2,100
courtrooms and approximately 14 million sf of usable area. The space includes public areas, such as courtrooms, waiting
areas, clerks' offices, child waiting, records viewing, rooms for jury assembly and deliberation, and centers for self-help,
alternative dispute resolution, and mediation, as well as private areas, such as judicial officer chambers, staff workspace,
storage space, training rooms, and conference rooms. Judicial Council staff facilities, occupying approximately 255,000 sf,
are located in San Francisco (Headquarters), Sacramento, and field offices throughout the state. Judicial Council
responsibility and management has gradually increased to what is now approximately 20 million square feet of facility space
statewide.

0280    Commission on Judicial Performance
 
The California Commission on Judicial Performance is the independent state agency responsible for investigating
complaints of judicial misconduct and judicial incapacity, and for disciplining judges pursuant to Article VI, Section 18 of the
California Constitution.  It is the only body with such authority in the state.  Its jurisdiction includes all active judges and
justices of California's superior courts, Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court, and former judges for conduct prior to
retirement or resignation.  The Commission also shares authority with the local courts for the oversight of court
commissioners and referees.  In addition to its disciplinary functions, the Commission is responsible for handling judges'
applications for disability retirement. 
 
The Commission's authority is limited to investigating alleged judicial misconduct and, if warranted, imposing discipline.
Judicial misconduct usually involves conduct in conflict with the standards set forth in the Code of Judicial Ethics.  After
investigation and, in some cases a public hearing, the Commission may impose sanctions ranging from confidential
discipline to removal from office. 
 
The Commission is composed of 11 members: 3 judges appointed by the Supreme Court; 2 attorneys appointed by the
Governor; and 6 lay citizens, of which 2 are appointed by the Governor, 2 are appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules,
and 2 are appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly.  Members are appointed to four-year terms and may serve two terms.
Commission members do not receive a salary.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
0390    Contributions to the Judges' Retirement System
 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement benefit funding for judges on California's Supreme, Appellate, and
Superior/Municipal courts. 
 
The Judges' Retirement System provides retirement, disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service,
compensation of active judges, and eligibility, as determined by specific sections of the Judges' Retirement Law.  Active
judges and the state each contribute 8 percent of salary to the Judges' Retirement System.  Additional contributions come
from filing fees for specific civil cases and investment income. These contributions, however, are not sufficient to fully fund
benefit payments.  Consequently, current law requires the state to fund the difference between existing contribution sources
and the required benefit payments to retired judges. 
 
A second retirement system for judges was established in 1994.  All new judges elected or appointed on or after November
9, 1994 become members of the Judges' Retirement System II.  The Judges' Retirement System II provides retirement,
disability, and death benefits based on age, years of service, final compensation, and eligibility, as determined by specific
sections of the Judges' Retirement System II Law. Members not eligible for a defined benefit receive the balance of their
monetary credits (in a lump-sum payment).  The Judges' Retirement System II receives contributions from judges equal to 8
percent of salary as well as any investment income.  The state's contributions are adjusted annually to maintain actuarial
soundness of the fund. Judges' Retirement System II members eligible for a service retirement have the option of choosing
the monetary credit plan (a lump-sum return of contributions and interest earned) or the defined benefit plan. 
 
Effective January 1, 2013, provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013, Chapter 296, Statutes
of 2012 (AB 340), require that new judges contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their pension benefits.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
The Budget includes an increase to the state's contribution due to the CalPERS Board's action in 2017 to lower the
assumed rate of return for the Judges' Retirement System II. The assumption change increased the system's liabilities,
resulting in an increase to the state's funding obligation.

The California Film Commission (CFC) enhances California's status as the leader in motion picture, television and
commercial production.  The Commission is tasked with retaining and increasing motion picture production and to see that it
continues to create jobs and boost business throughout the State.  A one-stop office for filmmakers, the Commission
supports productions of all sizes and budgets with a variety of services.  In addition to issuing film permits for all state
properties, administering the film and TV tax credit program, maintaining an extensive location library, and offering
production assistance on a wide variety of issues, CFC also works closely with cities and counties with the goal of creating
'film friendly" policies that are consistent state-wide. 
 
0235019 - DIVISION OF TOURISM 
 
The California Tourism Market Act provides for the marketing of California through an assessment of businesses that benefit

0235028 - CALIFORINIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK 
 
California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (IBank) was created to finance public infrastructure and private
development that promote a healthy climate for jobs, contribute to a strong economy and improve the quality of life in
California communities.  IBank has a broad authority to issue tax-exempt and taxable revenue bonds, provide financing to
public agencies, provide credit enhancements, acquire or lease facilities, and leverage State and Federal funds.  IBank's
current programs include the infrastructure state revolving fund, 501(c)(3) tax-exempt and taxable revenue bond program,

0235037 - SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM 
 
The Small Business Loan Guarantee Program (SBLGP) promotes local economic development by providing guarantees for
loans issued to small businesses from financial institutions, typically banks, that otherwise would not approve a term loan or
line of credit to a small business.  As a result of the SBLGP, participating small businesses are able to secure financing that
allows them to grow and expand their business.  The loan guarantee serves as a credit enhancement and an incentive for
financial institutions to make loans to small businesses that otherwise would not be eligible for such financing. 
 
0235046 - CALIFORNIA WELCOME CENTERS 
 
California Welcome Centers are visitor information centers that are readily accessible to and recognizable by tourists to

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
The Budget establishes a new Natural Resources and Parks Preservation Fund, which is a "pay as you go" special
fund to support natural resources programs previously funded by bond measures, such as water and flood
management, parks, forestry, land preservation, wildlife habitat, and climate adaptation. This new approach will be cost
effective, as the state will get double the value for each dollar compared to bond financing.  The amount of funding
allocated for this Fund will be determined on a year-to-year basis.

0552    Office of the Inspector General
 
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) protects public safety by safeguarding the integrity of California's correctional
system.  The OIG is responsible for contemporaneous oversight of the California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation's (CDCR) internal affairs investigations, use of force, and the employee disciplinary process.  When requested
by the Governor, the Senate Committee on Rules, or the Speaker of the Assembly, the Inspector General reviews the
policies, practices, and procedures of the CDCR.  The Inspector General reviews the Governor's candidates for appointment
to serve as warden for the state's adult correctional institutions and as superintendents for the state's juvenile facilities;
conducts metric-oriented inspection programs to periodically review delivery of medical care at each state prison and the
delivery of reforms implemented by the CDCR since 2012.  The OIG receives communications from individuals alleging
improper governmental activity and maintains a toll-free public telephone number to receive allegations of wrongdoing by
employees of the CDCR; conducts formal reviews of complaints of retaliation from CDCR employees against upper
management where a legally cognizable cause of action is present; and reviews the mishandling of sexual abuse incidents
within correctional institutions.  The OIG provides critical public transparency for the state correctional system by publicly
reporting its findings. 
 
In addition, the OIG is responsible for the California Rehabilitation Oversight Board (Board) that examines CDCR's various
mental health, substance abuse, educational, and employment programs for inmates and parolees. The Board meets at
least twice annually to recommend modifications, additions, and eliminations of offender rehabilitation and treatment
programs. The Board also submits biannual reports to the Governor, the Legislature, and the public to convey its findings on
the effectiveness of treatment efforts, rehabilitation needs of offenders, gaps in offender rehabilitation services, and levels of
offender participation and success.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
0690    Office of Emergency Services
 
The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (OES) is to protect lives and property, build capabilities, and
support our communities for a resilient California. The OES Director serves as both the Governor's Homeland Security
Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's homeland security
and counter-terrorism strategy. The OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting
against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of all hazards and threats. 
 
On a day-to-day basis, the OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and
coordinates with federal agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private
sector resources in emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction
relies first on its own resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. The OES' plans and programs are
coordinated with those of the federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within
California. 
 
During an emergency, the OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's
responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal
assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, the OES is responsible for the
development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes
prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 
 
The OES implements the state homeland security strategy by overseeing the State Threat Assessment System (STAS),
which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center (STAC). The STAS is comprised of four regional and
one major urban area Fusion Centers that assist in the detection, prevention, investigation, and response to criminal and
terrorist activity; and information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector
partners. The STAC operates as the state's information-sharing clearinghouse for strategic threat analysis, counter-
terrorism, situational awareness reporting, and case analysis for statewide leadership, agencies, and public safety
community. Further, the OES improves the criminal justice system in California by providing financial and technical
assistance to local governments, state agencies, and the private sector for homeland security, public safety, and victim
services. 
 
Because the OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
 
Through the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program, the OES provides effective use of federal,
state, and local resources, through the mutual aid system to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended in
a disaster situation. Also, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-hazards
approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National Strategy
on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this
program, the OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response
to all hazards. 
 
0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 
 
The OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim
services grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department
of Homeland Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, the OES serves as an advocate for local public safety,
emergency management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its
grant management role, the OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with
financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center which is the
centerpiece of the State's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary
fusion center. 
 
0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 
 
Public Safety Communications (PSC) serves the State of California by providing public safety communications to the State's
first responders and oversight of the 9-1-1 system to the people of California. The PSC is dedicated to the preservation and
protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services keeping the public
connected during times of crisis. 
 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE 
 
The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of the OES and support services such as
accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.

0750    Office of the Lieutenant Governor
 
Under California's Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor serves as Acting Governor whenever the Governor is absent from
the state, and automatically becomes Governor if a vacancy occurs in the Office of Governor. The Lieutenant Governor is
also President of the Senate and votes in case of a tie. 
 
The Lieutenant Governor serves as a voting member of the Board of Regents of the University of California and a voting
member of the Board of Trustees of the California State University system. 
 
The Lieutenant Governor also serves on, and rotates with the State Controller, as chair of the three-member State Lands
Commission, which oversees the control and leasing of millions of acres of state-owned land, including offshore oil
resources, as well as use and permitting for all navigable waterways in California. The Commission also manages state
land-use planning and revenues, and related interstate issues.  During alternate years, when the Lieutenant Governor
serves as Chairperson of the State Lands Commission, he also serves as a member of the Ocean Protection Council. 
 
In addition, under state statutes, the Lieutenant Governor chairs the California Commission for Economic Development,
which provides support and guidance to the Governor, Legislature and private sector regarding the development of
California's economy.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0435 - LEGAL SERVICES 
 
Legal Services is organized into three elements: (1) Civil Law, (2) Criminal Law, and (3) Public Rights. 
 
Civil Law represents the State of California and its officers, agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and employees in
civil matters. It provides advice to these clients, defends cases brought against them and prosecutes cases to vindicate state
interests. Deputy Attorneys General in Civil Law are responsible for managing and litigating cases before administrative
tribunals, and in both state and federal courts at the trial level and on appeal, including appeals before the United States and
California Supreme Courts. Deputies work in one of eight sections: Business and Tax; Correctional Law; Employment and
Administrative Mandates; Government Law; Health, Education and Welfare; Health Quality Enforcement; Licensing; or Tort
and Condemnation. 
 
Criminal Law represents the state in criminal matters before the Appellate and Supreme courts. Criminal Law also fulfills the
Attorney General's responsibilities of assisting district attorneys in cases for which they are recused, conducts criminal
investigations, represents the Governor, Board of Parole Hearings, and California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation in state and federal habeas corpus cases and appeals, and other proceedings relating to parole decisions and
conditions of confinement in the state prisons and defends state and federal habeas corpus matters. Additional
responsibilities include enforcing the Political Reform Act, advising the Governor on extradition matters, investigating and
prosecuting Medi-Cal provider fraud, investigating and prosecuting the abuse or neglect of elder and dependent adults
residing in long-term health care facilities, and investigating, prosecuting, and coordinating litigation involving white-collar
crime, high-tech/computer/privacy crime, financial crimes against the elderly, human trafficking, environmental crimes, and
public corruption. 
 
Public Rights protects and preserves the public interest by providing legal services to state agencies and Constitutional
Officers and by bringing actions in the name of the Attorney General to protect the public. Public Rights provides specialized
services in the following areas: Civil Rights Enforcement (including Underground Economy and the Bureau of Children's
Justice); Charitable Trusts (including the Registry of Charitable Trusts); Natural Resources Law; Corporate Fraud (including
False Claims, Energy and Corporate Responsibility); Indian and Gaming Law; Environment Law; Land Law; Consumer Law
(including Sellers of Travel and Privacy Enforcement and Protection); Antitrust Law; and Tobacco Litigation Enforcement. 
 
0440 - LAW ENFORCEMENT 
 
The Division of Law Enforcement is organized into five elements: (1) Bureau of Firearms, (2) Bureau of Forensic Services,
(3) Bureau of Gambling Control, (4) Bureau of Investigation, and (5) the Office of the Director. 
 
The Bureau of Firearms provides oversight, enforcement, education, and regulation of California's firearms/dangerous
weapon laws by conducting firearms eligibility background checks and administering over thirty different state-mandated
firearms-related programs. The Bureau conducts firearms dealer and manufacturer inspections and provides training as
needed. Special Agents conduct investigations on armed and prohibited persons and other investigations resulting in the
seizure of weapons. Agents also conduct firearms investigations to prevent illegal gun trafficking at in-state and out-of-state
gun shows in accordance with state and federal law. 
 
The Bureau of Forensic Services (BFS) provides evaluation and analysis of physical evidence, including crime scene

0820    Department of Justice - Continued
investigation and expert court testimony to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, district attorneys, and courts,
by operating 11 specialized laboratories that serve 46 counties as well as a forensic training facility. BFS maintains the state
DNA laboratory database which compiles DNA profiles of sex and violent offenders and felony arrestees. 
 
The Bureau of Gambling Control regulates legal gambling activities in California to ensure gambling is conducted honestly
and is free from criminal and corruptive elements. This is accomplished by investigating the qualifications of individuals and
business entities who apply for state gambling licenses and monitoring the conduct of these licensees to ensure compliance
with the Gambling Control Act. Furthermore, the Bureau conducts criminal investigations in, on or about Tribal casinos and
California cardrooms. The Bureau also regulates Tribal gaming to ensure that each Tribe is in compliance with all aspects of
the negotiated gaming compact. 
 
The Bureau of Investigation is the premiere investigative agency that is responsible for exploiting and dismantling criminal
organizations, as well as assisting with the prosecution of serious criminal offenses which present a significant and multi-
jurisdictional threat to California. The Bureau prioritizes investigations related to transnational criminal organizations involved
in gangs and human trafficking, as well as cases involving environmental crimes, public corruption, major fraud,
underground economy, and high-technology crimes. In addition, the Bureau serves a principal role in providing leadership,
coordination, and support to law enforcement through multi-agency drug, gang and major crimes task forces statewide. 
 
The Office of the Director enhances public safety by providing training, technical, and administrative support to the
investigative, regulatory and forensic components of the Division of Law Enforcement and other criminal justice agencies.
The Office serves as the policy-making and oversight body for its four operational bureaus. 
 
0445 - CALIFORNIA JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES 
 
The California Justice Information Services Division provides criminal justice intelligence, information, and identification
services to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, and the public. Four major functional areas carry out these primary
services: 1) The Bureau of Criminal Identification & Investigative Services consolidates the identification, investigative, and
field services functions, providing information and technical assistance on manual and automated systems including the
fingerprint identification system and the violent crime information system; 2) The Bureau of Criminal Information and
Analysis consolidates the functions related to the authorization, release, and use of criminal offender record information for
law enforcement investigatory and regulatory purposes; 3) The Hawkins Data Center operates the Criminal Justice
Information System and the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System; and 4) the Operations Support
Program provides business resumption planning and administrative support and oversight. 
 
9900 - DIRECTORATE AND ADMINISTRATION

the diverse programs and projects of the department, including the Equal Employment Rights and Resolution Office, the
Office of Program Review and Audits, the Opinions Unit, the Solicitor General's Unit, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the
Office of Communications and the Public Inquiry Unit. In addition, the Division of Administrative Support provides support

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0500100 - ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING 
 
The State Accounting and Reporting Division maintains uniform and systematic control accounts of all receipts, payments,
state fund balances, and bonded indebtedness; reports the financial condition of the state; monitors the cash flow of the
General Fund; administers the statewide discharge from accountability program; participates in offsetting monies owed to
the state; and collaborates with the Department of Finance, the Treasurer, and the Department of General Services to
develop and implement the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal) to ensure the system meets the state's
primary objectives and provides best business practices for the state. 
 
The Local Government Programs and Services Division maintains a database of information and reports on local financial
transactions and government compensation; apportions shared revenues to local governments; administers local mandated
cost programs; approves county cost allocation plans; prescribes uniform accounting procedures for presentation of financial
data for local governments and trial court revenues; administers and collects estate and inheritance taxes; collects
delinquent insurance and motor vehicle fuel taxes and petroleum and gas assessments; refunds gasoline taxes paid on fuel
consumed for off-highway purposes; instructs and advises county tax collectors; and administers the Property Tax
Postponement Program for senior and disabled citizens.  
 
0500200 - AUDITS 
 
The Audits Division determines the legality and accuracy of all claims against the state through the performance of
prepayment audits; assures the accuracy of local government claims and financial statements submitted to the state and
federal governments by establishing and updating audit guidelines, and reviewing audits performed by independent auditors;
performs field audits for a variety of state and federal programs; reviews the single audits reports of local governments and
local education agencies that receive "pass-through federal funds" from state agencies; and audits major businesses for
compliance with the Unclaimed Property Law. 
 
0500300 - PERSONNEL/PAYROLL SERVICES 
 
The Personnel/Payroll Services Division administers the state's payroll, employment history, the automated travel expense
reimbursement system, and leave accounting processes in a manner that provides accurate, timely and efficient processing
for the users of these systems.  The Division works with other entities, e.g., Department of Human Resources, Judicial
Council, Department of Finance, and California State University Chancellor's Office, to maximize the efficiency of the state's
personnel and payroll functions, while continuing to maintain the highest level and quality of customer service. 
 
The 21st Century Project was initiated to replace existing statewide human resource management systems with a fully
integrated solution; however, the project was suspended in February 2013, after an unsuccessful eight-month pilot program,
and terminated in June 2016, after reaching a settlement with the system integrator.  The SCO will assess current
information technology alternatives and the latest industry standards to analyze alternatives through the California

inquiries and complaints annually; performs examinations to ensure the financial solvency of companies; receives more than
30,000 suspected fraudulent claim referrals annually; receives and reviews approximately 7,250 rate filing applications

0845    Department of Insurance - Continued
 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) prevent losses to policyholders, beneficiaries or the public due to the insolvency of
insurers; (2) prevent unlawful or unfair practices by insurers as defined by the Insurance Code; (3) ensure that property and
casualty insurance rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the Insurance
Code and the California Code of Regulations; (4) review health insurance rates filed with CDI to determine whether they are
reasonable and attempt to get unreasonable rates lowered by insurers; and (5) ensure that applicants for insurance licenses,
and holders of insurance licenses, satisfy and maintain the qualifications for licensure. Through the Conservation and
Liquidation Office, the CDI administers the estates of insolvent and delinquent insurance companies. 
 
0525 - CONSUMER PROTECTION 
 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) provide direct service to California consumers by protecting insurance
policyholders and other parties involved in insurance transactions against unfair or illegal practices with respect to claims
handling, rating or underwriting by insurers and (2) protect applicants and policyholders from discriminatory, unlawful or
fraudulent practices or incompetence relating to the sale of insurance. 
 
0530 - FRAUD CONTROL 
 
The objective of this program is to protect the public from economic loss by actively investigating, arresting and referring for
prosecution or adjudication those who commit insurance fraud and other violations of the law. The program is primarily
staffed by sworn peace officers who conduct criminal investigations of insurance fraud and related criminal cases. The
program also implements the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which authorizes the Commissioner to initiate or intervene in
whistle-blower "qui tam" actions seeking civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud. 
 
0535 - GENERAL FUND TAX COLLECTION AND COMPLIANCE 
 
This program performs tax collection; ensures compliance from insurance companies and surplus line brokers with the laws
contained in the Insurance Code and Revenue and Taxation Code; and works with the Board of Equalization and State
Controller's Office with various refund, assessment, and accounting matters relative to the premium tax program. Tax
collections from this program are deposited in the state's General Fund. 
 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
 
This program provides administrative support services to the CDI including budgets, accounting, human resources, business
services and information technology, as well as legislative and legal services.

0850    California State Lottery Commission
 
In 1984, Proposition 37 amended the California Constitution to authorize the establishment of a statewide lottery. As an
initiative statute, the California State Lottery Act (Act) of 1984 created the California State Lottery Commission and gave it
broad powers to oversee the operations of a statewide lottery. The purpose of the Act was to provide supplemental monies
to benefit public education. The Lottery is overseen by a five-person Commission appointed by the Governor and confirmed
by the State Senate. 
 
The Act initially required that 50 percent of total annual revenues be returned to the public in the form of prizes and at least
34 percent of total revenues be allocated to the benefit of public education. No more than 16 percent of total revenues were
to be used for administrative costs. 
 
In 2010, the Act was changed to allow the Lottery flexibility to pay out more money in prizes and reduce the administrative
cost limit to 13 percent of total revenues. Along with that flexibility, the new law requires the Lottery to meet minimum levels
of contribution to public education. Revenues to education are placed in a special fund, known as the California State Lottery
Education Fund, which holds revenues until they are allocated on a per capita basis, using prior year certified Average Daily
Attendance data, to the following categories: K-12 education, Community Colleges, the California State University, the
University of California, and other educational entities, including the California Schools for the Deaf and Blind. 
 
In the 31 years since sales began in October 1985 through June 30, 2016, the California State Lottery has raised nearly $31
billion for public education, including $1.59 billion in FY 2015-16. 
 
Because of the inherently variable nature of lottery ticket sales, revenue estimates for 2016-17 and 2017-18 cannot be made
with certainty.

Distribution of State Lottery Education Fund Revenues
0855    California Gambling Control Commission
 
The mission of the California Gambling Control Commission (Commission) is to ensure integrity in California's gaming
environment.  The Commission has jurisdiction over gambling establishments (cardrooms), third-party providers of
proposition player services, and certain aspects of Tribal casinos, pursuant to its authority under state law and Tribal-State
Gaming Compacts (Compacts). The Commission also has jurisdiction over gaming policies, regulations, criteria, and
standards. 
 
There are 89 licensed cardrooms in California over which the Commission has broad regulatory and adjudicatory authority.
This authority extends to the operation, concentration, and supervision of the cardrooms and all persons and things related
to each licensed establishment. 
 
The Commission has fiduciary, regulatory, and administrative responsibilities related to Tribal gaming that include: (1)
distributing Tribal gaming revenues to Non-Compact, Non-Gaming and Limited-Gaming Tribes; (2) making suitability
determinations for key employees, vendors, and financial sources; and (3) serving as the administrator of the Indian Gaming
Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, and the Tribal Nation Grant Fund.

0860    State Board of Equalization
 
Prior to July 1, 2017, the State Board of Equalization (BOE) administered various tax and fee programs including the Sales
and Use tax, adopted rules and regulations to clarify tax laws, acted as an appellate body for the review of property,
business and income tax assessments, assessed and allocated the property values of railroads and specified utilities and
businesses, and oversaw the property tax assessment practices of all 58 county assessors. 
 
Effective July 1, 2017, legislation enacted as part of the 2017 Budget Act recast the BOE as the California Department of
Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA).  The CDTFA will perform those statutory duties formerly assigned to the BOE, except
for tax appeals.  The BOE will continue in existence, but will handle only those duties assigned to it by the California
Constitution, namely the assessment and allocation of the property values of railroads and specified utilities and businesses,
and the oversight of the property tax assessment practices of all 58 county assessors.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Legislation enacted concurrent with the 2017 Budget Act recast the State Board of Equalization (BOE) as the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) effective July 1, 2017.  The CDTFA will have a Director appointed by
the Governor, and it will operate under the Government Operations Agency.  The CDTFA will perform those statutory
duties previously performed by the BOE, other than tax appeals, which will be assigned to the newly created Office of Tax
Appeals effective January 1, 2018.  The BOE will remain in existence, but it will be responsible only for those duties
assigned to it by the California Constitution.  The BOE will house the Board Members and their staff, together with those
current BOE civil service employees who work in those programs still under the BOE's jurisdiction.  All other BOE civil
service employees will transition to the CDTFA.  Both the CDTFA and the BOE will be funded in 2017-18 from the
appropriations provided by the 0860 Budget Unit.

The Secretary of State, as California's chief elections officer, has broad responsibility to administer the election process. This
program oversees all federal and state elections within California, maintaining a statewide database of all registered voters,

modernization of voting equipment and the improvement of current electoral database systems, enhancing the voting
processes, providing accessibility to voters, working to increase people's knowledge of the electoral system, and
investigates election related criminal violations as provided by California Elections Code. 
 
This program includes the campaign and lobbying registration and disclosure provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974.
Under this law, the Office registers all levels of campaign committees, and reviews for compliance with statutory
requirements all state-level candidate and campaign recipient committees, major donors, slate mailer, political party, and
independent expenditure committees. The program registers lobbyists (including placement agents), lobbying firms and
lobbyist employers, reviews for compliance with statutory requirements the periodic financial disclosure reports filed by
lobbying entities, and publishes a Lobbying Directory on the Internet. This program also supports the electronic filing
requirements of the Political Reform Act and posts relevant registration and disclosure information to the Office's web site so
the public can track where campaign money is raised and spent and what lobbying activity is occurring in state government.
A searchable database of campaign and lobbying financial activity is also provided through the web site.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0740010 - INVESTMENT SERVICES 
 
The Investment Division is responsible for investment of state monies from the date of receipt through the date of
redemption. During the 2015-16 fiscal year, this Division handled 7,359 security investment transactions totaling $312.9
billion. The Pooled Money Investment Board (PMIB) program accounted for 5,337 of these transactions totaling $266.1
billion; time deposits accounted for 1,599 transactions totaling $37.5 billion. The remaining $9.3 billion is invested on behalf
of the state's special funds, such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish
and Wildlife, the state's retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a
voluntary investment program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the
PMIB program. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, 2,479 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $20.9 billion for
the fiscal year. 
 
0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 
 
In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System
(CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires
the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB,
giving the Board the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank
deposits, and loans to the General Fund. 
 
The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal
of the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure
that the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The State
Treasurer maintains demand bank accounts with eight banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository
coverage for the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 
 
The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts
available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire
transfer of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks and redeems all state items submitted by presenting
banks for payments, 5) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS)
and securities pledged to the state, 6) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state for the time,
demand, and other state agency programs, and 7) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal
property owned by or pledged to the state. 
 
0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE 
 
The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling  State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes,
revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The
Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to
bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 
 
The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to state debt so there is no adverse consequences to
bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state.  The post-issuance tax compliance for various state debt includes
monitoring the use of bond proceeds, monitoring use of bond financed property, tracking expenditures, managing rebate and
yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and ensuring proper record keeping. 
 
0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
 
The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support
services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information
systems, business services, technical support, and production operations.

0959    California Debt Limit Allocation Committee
 
The California Debt Limit Allocation Committee's mission is to allocate tax-exempt private activity bond authority for the State
of California.  Private activity bonds may only be used by the private sector for projects and programs that provide a public
benefit, such as the creation of affordable housing. 
 
The federal government limits the amount of tax-exempt private activity bond authority that can be issued on an annual
basis.  Except for the Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program, the bond authority limit is calculated by multiplying
the state population by $100.  The state debt (or tax-exempt bond) limit totaled over $3.92 billion in 2017.  The limit for the
Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program is calculated by multiplying the state population by $10, and totaled $392
million for 2017. 
 
The Committee's allocation of tax-exempt bond authority results in the issuance of bonds by cities, counties, joint powers
authorities and state agencies.  The bonds are purchased and used by the private sector and are not an obligation of the
state or of the federal government. 
 
The Committee administers 10 programs that are funded through the allocation and issuance of tax-exempt private activity
bonds, and is also responsible for the reallocation of Qualified Energy Conservation Bond (QECB) authority originally
provided to qualified localities, but later waived back to the state.  The QECB program, made available through the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, provides tax incentives and lower borrowing costs for local governments and
private entities to promote job creation and economic recovery in areas particularly affected by employment decline and to
facilitate renewable energy conservation programs and projects throughout the state. 
 
The Committee is funded on a fee-supported basis and is comprised of the State Treasurer as Chairperson, the Governor,
or upon his designation, the Director of Finance, and the State Controller.

Specified entities can issue various bonds, including mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs) that support below-market interest
rates for the specified loans; and mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that are used to reduce a homebuyer's federal tax
liability. Below is a discussion of each program: 
 
Qualified Residential Rental Project Program: 
These tax-exempt housing revenue bonds assist developers of multifamily rental housing units to acquire land and construct
new units or purchase and rehabilitate existing units.  The tax-exempt bonds lower the interest rate on a mortgage to be paid
by the developers.  The developers, in turn, produce affordable and market rate rental housing for low and very low-income
households by reducing rental rates to these individuals and families. Projects that receive an award of bond authority have
the right to apply for non-competitive four-percent tax credits. 
 
Single-Family Housing Program: 
These tax-exempt MRBs or MCCs assist first-time homebuyers with purchasing homes.  Homebuyers may purchase single-
family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses.  Program participants must meet income
limits and must purchase a home that falls within the program's purchase price limitations. 
 
Home Improvement and Rehabilitation Bond Program: 
MRBs or MCCs may be used to assist homeowners with home improvement financing.  Homeowners may improve single-
family homes, either freestanding or detached, condominiums, or townhouses.  Program participants must meet income
limits, and in certain cases, must own a home that falls within the program's rehabilitation cost and age-of-home limitations. 
 
Extra Credit Home Purchase Program: 
These MRBs or MCCs assist teachers, principals and other eligible school staff with purchasing homes. 
 
Industrial Development Bond Project Program: 
Small-Issue industrial development bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds that are issued to assist manufacturing
facilities finance capital expenditures.  These bonds offer interest rate savings to small and midsize manufacturers in
contrast to conventional loans, and help manufacturers retain and create new jobs within their communities. 
 
Exempt Facility Program: 
Exempt Facility Bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds that are issued to finance solid waste disposal and waste
recycling facilities.  The tax-exempt bonds provide facility owners with low-cost financing in the form of below-market interest
rate loans.  The interest rate savings enable the project owners to maintain lower customer rates or minimize customer rate
increases, while at the same time assisting the communities they serve to meet mandated requirements to protect and
enhance the environment. 
 
Student Loan Program: 
Student Loan Bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds issued for the purpose of either financing direct loans to college
students and their parents or purchasing bundles of already-originated loans on the secondary market.  When used for direct
lending programs, tax-exempt bond allocation allows lenders to pass on interest rate savings to financially needy students
via below-market interest rate loans.

Beginning Farmer Bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds that are issued to back below-market interest rate financing
for eligible agricultural land, construction/improvements, breeder livestock and equipment for qualified farmers.  Eligibility,
permissible items, and loan limits are set by the United States Internal Revenue Code.  Under the program, a conduit bond
issuer applies to the Committee for an allocation of Beginning Farmer Bonds.  If the Committee approves the allocation, the
issuer then brings together farmers, financial institutions, contract sellers or investors to negotiate terms of a transaction. 
 
Qualified Public Educational Facility Bond Program: 
Qualified Public Educational Facility Bonds (QPEF's) are tax-exempt private activity bonds issued to finance the
construction, renovation, and furnishing of primary and secondary school facilities. This form of financing reduces the cost of
financing for schools as interest earned by the lender is tax exempt. 
 
Qualified Energy Conservation Bond Program: 
Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) may be issued as either tax-exempt private activity bonds or governmental
purpose taxable bonds.  When issued as a governmental purpose taxable bond, QECBs provide the issuer with either a
direct or tax credit interest subsidy.  QECBs may be issued to finance a broad array of qualified conservation purposes such
as capital expenditures, research facilities and research grant programs, mass commuting facilities, public education
campaigns and demonstration projects.

The core program area is the Industrial Development Bond Program, under which the Commission serves as the mandatory
approval agency for the local bond issuers.  Once potential borrowers (manufacturers and processing companies) apply
through their local government agency for low cost tax-exempt financing, the Commission carefully reviews the public
benefits generated by the proposed project, particularly those benefits associated with job creation, and determines whether
these benefits will significantly outweigh any detrimental public effects.  Eligible capital expenditures include the acquisition
of land, building construction, building renovation, and the purchase of machinery and equipment.  Bond proceeds also can
be used to cover the cost of architects, engineers, attorneys, permits, and the cost of bond issuance.  The local issuer can
be a city, county, economic development authority, or a joint power authority.

0968    California Tax Credit Allocation Committee
 
The mission of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee is to fairly allocate federal and state tax credits to create and
maintain safe quality affordable rental housing for low-income households in California by forming partnerships with
developers, investors and public entities. 
 
The Committee works in public/private partnerships to assist with low-income multi-family rental housing project
development, while fulfilling its responsibilities as a credit agency through project compliance monitoring. The Committee
also coordinates its functions with state and local housing fund providers and with private fund investors, when providing and
maintaining quality, affordable housing. 
 
The Committee consists of seven members, including the Treasurer who is designated as Chairperson, the Governor or
Director of Finance, the State Controller, the Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, the
Executive Director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and two local government representatives.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0840 - CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE 
 
The Federal Low-Income Housing Tax-Credit Program: 
 
Congress authorized the federal program in 1986. It replaced traditional housing tax incentives, such as accelerated
depreciation, with a tax credit that enables developers of affordable rental housing to raise project equity through the "sale"
of tax benefits to investors. 
 
The annual housing credit ceiling is indexed for inflation. As of 2016, each state has an annual housing credit ceiling of
$2.35 per state resident, and may qualify for a share of credits available annually in a national pool comprised of states'
unused credits. Investors can take the annual credit against their federal income tax liability each year for a ten-year period. 
 
The State Low-Income Housing Tax-Credit Program: 
 
Recognizing the high cost of developing housing in California, the California Legislature authorized the State Low-Income
Housing Tax-Credit Program to augment the federal tax credit program. Specifically, projects that are not receiving an
increase in their federal tax credit basis may apply for and receive state tax credits. However, an exception to this rule is in
place for projects serving special needs populations (as defined in Section 10325 of the California Code of Regulations).
Those projects may apply for and receive state tax credits even if they are receiving an increase in their federal tax credit
basis. The project's "eligible basis" is the portion of the total project cost that is used to calculate the amount of the tax credit. 
 
The annual state credit ceiling is currently $94.5 million, indexed for inflation. Investors take the state credit over a four-year
period in contrast to the ten-year federal allocation period. 
 
Tax-Exempt Bond Financed Program: 
 
Developments financed with tax-exempt bond proceeds may also receive federal tax credit. The sponsors of such projects
must apply to the Committee and must conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory requirements, but
there is no annual cap on the amount of credit that may be awarded by the state to such developments. The annual credit
available is based on approximately four percent of the qualified basis of the development. The qualified basis includes
those costs attributable to the units that will be income and rent restricted for a minimum of 30 years. 
 
Under federal law, credit projects must remain affordable for at least 30 years; however, California's program generally
requires maintaining affordability for 55 years. Land use agreements are recorded against each credit project to ensure
compliance. 
 
Farmworker Housing Tax-Credit Program: 
 
Chapter 521, Statutes of 2008 folded the previous Farmworker Housing Assistance tax credits into the general state low-
income housing tax-credit program. While $500,000 annually continues to be authorized for state tax credits in support of
farmworker housing, the program now operates under the rules of the general state low-income housing tax-credit program.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
0971    California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority
 
The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority was established by Chapter 908,
Statutes of 1980, to promote the prompt and efficient development of energy sources which are renewable or which more
efficiently utilize and conserve scarce energy resources.  Recognizing the importance of developing a secure energy future
to protect the environment and ensure economic stability, the Authority advances the state's goals of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions by providing financing options to assist industries in increasing the deployment of sustainable and renewable
energy sources, implementing measures that increase the efficiency of the use of energy, creating high quality employment
opportunities, and lessening the state's dependence on fossil fuels.  To support these goals, the Authority provides financing
and credit enhancements to promote the establishment of facilities that use alternative methods and sources of energy, and
facilities needed for the development and commercialization of advanced transportation technologies. 
 
The Authority consists of five members: the State Treasurer, who serves as the chairperson, the State Controller, the
Director of the Department of Finance, the Chairperson of the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission, and the President of the Public Utilities Commission.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0850 - ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
 
Financial assistance can take the form of loans, loan loss reserves, interest rate reductions, proceeds of bonds issued by the
authority, bond insurance, loan guarantees or other credit enhancements or liquidity facilities, contributions of money, or a
combination thereof, as determined and approved by resolution of the Authority. 
 
In 2010, the Authority launched a sales and use tax exclusion (STE) program for advanced transportation and alternative
source manufacturing in California (Chapter 10, Statutes of 2010) and subsequently, Chapter 677, Statutes of 2012,
expanded the STE program to include advanced manufacturing, with an annual cap of $100 million available for STE
awards.  Chapter 768, Statutes of 2015, further expanded the program to also include equipment primarily used to process
recycled feedstock and equipment that primarily utilizes recycled feedstock in the production of another product.  The
objective of this program is to promote the creation of California-based manufacturing, businesses, and jobs that are aimed
at reducing greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, and energy consumption. 
 
Legislation in 2010 (Chapter 15, Statutes of 2010), 2011 (Chapter 9, Statutes of 2011, First Extraordinary Session), and
2013 (Chapter 356, Statutes of 2013), authorized financial assistance to encourage energy efficiency retrofits.  The Authority
developed a loan loss reserve program to assist financial institutions in making loans to homeowners in the state for
residential whole house energy efficiency and renewable energy projects, and developed a risk mitigation program for
residential Property Assessed Clean Energy programs in California. 
 
Most recently, the Budget Act of 2014 authorized administration of the California Hub for Energy Efficiency Financing on
behalf of, and in collaboration with, the California Public Utilities Commission. These energy efficiency financing pilot
programs will employ various types of credit enhancements to encourage and leverage private capital lending (in both the
residential and commercial sectors) for energy efficiency improvements needed to help achieve California's energy efficiency
goals.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0860 - POLLUTION CONTROL TAX-EXEMPT BOND PROGRAM 
 
The objective of this program is to provide bond financing to California businesses, irrespective of company size, for the
acquisition, construction, or installation of qualified pollution control, waste disposal, water furnishing, wastewater treatment,
waste recovery facilities, and the acquisition and installation of new equipment. Tax-exempt financing issued by the Authority
assists municipalities in complying with waste diversion mandates of the California Integrated Waste Management Act of
1989. As of June 30, 2016, bonds totaling approximately $14.8 billion have been issued by the Authority. 
 
0865 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES 
 
The objective of this program is to encourage banks and other financial institutions to make loans to small businesses.
CalCAP for Small Businesses is a form of loan portfolio insurance that may provide up to 100 percent coverage on certain
loan defaults. By participating in CalCAP, lenders have available to them a proven financing mechanism to meet the
financing needs of California's small businesses. The strength of CalCAP rests in its simplicity and its leverage of federal
and state funds. The program works through the creation of a loan loss-reserve fund for each participating financial
institution. The Authority funds this reserve together with the financial institution and the borrower. Additional incentives are
provided to lend to businesses located in specified communities. The reserve serves to reduce loan-loss risk, allowing banks
to lend to targeted California small businesses. Chapter 731, Statutes of 2010, appropriated $6 million General Fund to
CalCAP to increase lending efforts. As of June 30, 2016, approximately $3.5 million of the $6 million has been used to assist
small businesses. 
 
In addition, California was awarded an allocation of federal funds in the amount of $168.6 million from the federal State
Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The Authority and the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development
(Go-BIZ) equally share this allocation of $84.3 million each. These funds have enabled the Authority to significantly expand
the availability of its CalCAP program statewide. The Authority also launched the Collateral Support Program to assist more
small businesses and utilize the SSBCI Federal funds. Funds were allocated to California in three installments based on
program progress.  The Authority received $27 million in March 2011, $27 million in December 2013, and $29 million in
August 2015. 
 
Utilizing the CalCAP model, the Authority has partnered with the Air Resources Board (ARB) to assist diesel truck and
equipment owners in meeting new clean air requirements by directing a total of $95 million in Air Quality Improvement
Program funds towards the purchase or retrofit of diesel trucks to comply with ARB's Statewide Truck and Bus Rule. The
Authority has also partnered with the California Energy Commission to implement a $2 million pilot program to provide credit
enhancements and rebates to small business borrowers who install electric vehicle charging stations. Similarly, the Authority
is partnering with the Department of Resources, Recycling, and Recovery to assist with the financing of important state
recycling objectives. 
 
0870 - CALIFORNIA RECYCLE UNDERUTILIZED SITES PROGRAM 
 
The CALReUSE program assists with the reuse and redevelopment of underutilized properties with real or perceived
contamination issues (brownfields). CALReUSE addresses a funding and information gap in the development of brownfields
to help bring these properties into productive reuse. Beginning in 2000, the CALReUSE Assessment Program provided
forgivable loans of up to $300,000 per brownfield site. The funds assisted with brownfield site assessment and
characterization, technical assistance, remedial action plans and site access. Eligible projects included sites with potential
beneficial reuse not currently redeveloped due to lack of information about real or perceived contamination, uncertainty
about clean-up costs, or concerns regarding time frames and the regulatory process.

Additionally, Proposition 1C, the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006, included provisions to fund
brownfield cleanup that resulted in the expansion of CALReUSE. The CALReUSE Remediation Program received $60
million in Proposition 1C funds and is providing up to $5 million per project in loans and grants for the purpose of brownfield
cleanup that promotes infill residential and mixed-used development, including affordable housing, consistent with regional
and local land use plans. 
 
0875 - ALTERNATIVE FINANCING PROGRAMS 
 
Under its authority to provide alternative methods of financing facilities for pollution control, clean water supply and
alternative energy production, the Authority is developing alternative financing models to assist sister agencies with
achieving the state's environmental goals. The Authority is authorized to receive and accept contributions from other sources
including federal and state agencies to carry out the purposes of its statutory authority. 
 
0876 - CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABLITIES
ACT 
 
The objective of this program, created by Chapter 787, Statutes of 2015, is to help small businesses comply with the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act and increase access for their employees and customers by encouraging lenders and other
financial institutions to make loans to very small businesses to finance tenant improvements. The Legislature provided the
Authority an appropriation of $10 million effective January 1, 2016, to administer a credit enhancement program following the
CalCAP model and create loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program. 
 
0877 - CALIFORNIA SEISMIC SAFETY CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN PROGRAM 
 
The California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program authorized by Chapter 32, Statutes of 2016, provided a
one-time allocation of $10 million to provide an accessible loan program to qualified small businesses and residential
property owners (including multiunit dwellings and mobile homes registered by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development) for costs related to seismic retrofitting. The Program encourages banks and other financial
institutions to participate by creating loan loss reserve accounts for lenders that enroll qualifying loans into the program. The
loans to small businesses and residential property owners are for financing seismic retrofits of real property to reduce losses
and mitigate seismic damage.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0880 - CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROGRAM 
 
In 2004, California voters approved Proposition 61, which established the Children's Hospital Program. In 2008, Proposition
3 established the second Children's Hospital Program.  The purpose of both programs is to improve the health and welfare
of California's critically ill children by providing a stable and ready source of funds for capital improvement projects for
children's hospitals.  Children's Hospital Program grant funding is derived from the issuance of general obligation bonds, up
to $750 million under Proposition 61 and $980 million under Proposition 3.

The Authority serves as a conduit provider of tax-exempt bonds and a direct provider of financial assistance to health
institutions. 
 
Tax-Exempt Bond Program 
 
Bonds issued under this conduit program are not a debt or liability or a pledge of the full faith and credit of the taxing power
of the state or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the participating institutions are pledged for
repayment of the bonds. To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit
corporation or association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district. 
 
Clinic Grant Programs 
 
Chapter 99, Statutes of 2000 (AB 2875), established the Cedillo-Alarcon Community Clinic Investment Act of 2000 and
allocated $50 million dollars to the Authority for the purpose of awarding grants to eligible primary care clinics for capital
outlay projects.  In 2004, as part of the Anthem-Well Point merger, $35 million dollars was allocated to the Authority for the
purpose of awarding grants to eligible health care facilities providing service to underserved communities throughout
California.  To qualify for funding, the proposed project must be a health facility, operated by a private nonprofit corporation
or association, city, city and county, county, or hospital district. 
 
HELP II Loan Program 
 
The Authority administers the Healthcare Expansion Loan Program II (HELP II) to assist small and rural health facilities in
obtaining financing for their capital needs. The HELP II Program provides two percent and three percent fixed interest rate
loans of up to $1,500,000 to California's nonprofit small and rural health facilities in an efficient, timely, and cost effective
manner. The two percent interest rate applies to loans approved from April 30, 2015 - April 30, 2017, and is effective for the
life of the loan.  Refinancing loans are not eligible for the two percent interest rate. Refinancing loans are eligible up to
$1,000,000. HELP II loans may be used to purchase or construct new facilities, remodel or renovate existing facilities,
purchase equipment and/or furnishings, and refinance existing debt. 
 
California Health Access Model Program 
 
Chapter 23, Statutes of 2012 (AB 1467) authorized the California Health Access Model Program (CHAMP), a grant program
intended to support innovative methods of delivering health care services and improve health outcomes for vulnerable
populations and communities by bringing services to individuals where they live or congregate. 
 
0890 - MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANTS 
 
Chapter 34, Statutes of 2013 (SB 82), the Investment in Mental Health Wellness Act of 2013 and related legislation provided
$142.5 million in one-time General Fund, and $4 million in ongoing Mental Health Services Act funding to provide grants for
community based mental health crisis support, which may also be eligible for matching federal funding. 
 
The Act established a grant program to disburse funds to California counties or to their nonprofit or public agency designates
for the purpose of developing mental health crisis support programs. Specifically, funds will increase capacity for client
assistance and services in crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, crisis residential treatment, rehabilitative mental health
services, and mobile crisis support teams. The grants will support capital improvement, expansion and limited start-up costs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0895 - CALIFORNIA ABLE ACT BOARD 
 
On December 19, 2014, President Obama signed the Stephen Beck Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (the
ABLE Act), which allows individuals who became blind or disabled before reaching age 26, to create tax-free savings
accounts.  Individuals can make nondeductible cash contributions to an ABLE account in the name of a specified beneficiary
with tax-free earnings.  ABLE account distributions are also not included in the beneficiary's income, as long as they are
used for qualified services.  Chapter 774, Statutes of 2015 (AB 449), implements the ABLE Act in California, and directs the
State Treasurer to administer ABLE accounts on behalf of qualified Californians. 
 
The California Achieving a Better Life Experience Act Board and the California ABLE Program Trust were established by
Chapter 796, Statutes of 2015 (SB 324), for the purpose of creating a statewide program known as the Qualified ABLE
Program (the Program).  Under the Program, a person may make contributions of up to $100,000 for a taxable year, for the
benefit of an individual who is an eligible individual for that taxable year, to an ABLE account that is established for the
purpose of meeting the qualified expenses of the designated beneficiary of the account.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Charter School Facility Grant Program-The budget has been adjusted to increase the per student funding rate to $1,117
for the 2017-18 fiscal year and provides an ongoing cost-of-living adjustment for the program moving forward. 
 
DETAILED BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS
 
 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0918 - SMART BONDS PROGRAM 
 
Chapter 1438, Statutes of 1985, as amended by Chapter 598, Statutes of 1987, established CSFA and authorized the
issuance of revenue bonds or other debt instruments. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds were available for loans to
school and community college districts to assist with the acquisition of equipment and new school sites, construction of new
facilities, reconstruction of existing facilities, capital improvements, and to provide working capital. Chapter 325, Statutes of
2006 (AB 2717), allows CSFA to issue debt on behalf of California charter schools for capital improvements and working
capital needs. 
 
0920 - CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM 
 
Chapter 935, Statutes of 2002, as amended by Chapter 587, Statutes of 2003, created the Charter School Facilities
Program (CSFP), which provides funding for the new construction, renovation or rehabilitation of charter school facilities.
CSFA and the Office of Public School Construction jointly administer the program. CSFP was funded through the
Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Acts of 2002, 2004, and 2006, for a total of $900 million.
Proposition 51, approved by voters in November 2016, extends the existing CSFP and authorized a total of $500 million in
State General Obligation Bonds for charter school construction projects. 
 
The program provides a 50 percent state subsidy for the charter school facilities project costs, with the balance of the project
costs being repaid (to the state) by the charter school in the form of a long-term lease. Recipient charter schools must
provide site-based instruction, be deemed financially sound by CSFA, and meet other program eligibility requirements. 
 
0925 - STATE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES INCENTIVE GRANTS PROGRAM 
 
In 2004, 2009, and 2014, CSFA was awarded a grant under the United States Department of Education's State Charter
School Facilities Incentive Grants Program (CFDA 84.282D) to provide California charter schools with assistance for
facilities costs. Grant funds are used toward a charter school's cost of rent, lease, mortgage or debt service payments for
existing or new facilities or toward the costs of acquiring land and constructing or renovating a facility. Grants are awarded to
charter schools based on preference points allotted by the percentage of low-income students, percentage overcrowded,
not-for-profit status, and demonstrated student performance. Schools cannot use program funds to supplant state funding.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
0940 - BOND FINANCING 
 
CEFA issues revenue bonds to assist private educational institutions of higher learning construct educational facilities.
Because it is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds, the Authority may be able to provide more favorable financing terms
than might otherwise be obtainable. CEFA also may include qualifying nonprofit entities as eligible program participants for
the construction of student and faculty housing. Bonds issued by CEFA are not a debt, liability, or claim on the faith and
credit or the taxing power of the State of California or any of its political subdivisions. The full faith and credit of the
participating institution is normally pledged to the payment of the bonds. Bonds issued for this purpose are not subject to the
state's "private activity" bond ceiling as specified in federal law. 
 
For purposes of the California Educational Facilities Act, "private college" or "private participating college" means a private
college that does not restrict the admission of a student based on his or her race or ethnicity, provided that the financing
does not violate constitutional provisions. 
 
"Bond" means bonds, notes, debentures, securities, or other evidences of indebtedness. This broad definition allows CEFA
to issue tax-exempt direct or private placement loans for colleges and universities, which may provide greater cost savings
than these colleges and universities might otherwise realize on a traditional bond financing. 
 
0955 - COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND 
 
Chapter 367, Statutes of 2014, required CEFA to administer the College Access Tax Credit Fund and allocate and certify the
tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2017. Chapter 22, Statutes of
2015, added a requirement that CEFA continue to allocate and certify the tax credits for taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2018.
