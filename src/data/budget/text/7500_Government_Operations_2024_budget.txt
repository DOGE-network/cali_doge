county assessors assess all properties. 
6275050 - STATE-ASSESSED PROPERTY PROGRAM 
The CDTFA provides administrative services including accounting, budgeting, business services, health and safety, human 
resources, information technology, labor relations, training, procurement, and contracting to support the BOE's State-Assessed 
Property program. This program is responsible for valuing and assessing inter-county pipelines and properties owned or used 
by railroads, regulated telephone companies, companies transmitting or selling gas or electricity, and private railroad car 
companies. Local jurisdictions use the established values for the levy and collection of local property taxes. 
6275075 - TIMBER TAX PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the Timber Tax Fund. The revenue, less administrative costs, is allocated to the counties 
where the timber was harvested. The CDTFA administers and collects the Timber Yield Tax, a property tax paid by timber 
owners when they harvest trees or timber. The CDTFA determines the harvest values of timber and timberland production zone 
values. 
6275100 - SALES AND USE TAX PROGRAM 
This program ensures that all sales and use tax revenues are collected in an equitable and effective manner through accurate 
reporting of tax liability. This is accomplished by detecting and correcting errors in self-assessments, and promptly collecting 
amounts determined to be due and economically recoverable. Under this program, the CDTFA administers the following taxes: 
State Sales and Use Tax, Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax, and District Transactions and Use Tax (cities/
counties). 
6275125 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES TAX PROGRAM 
These programs provide revenue for the Hazardous Waste Control Account (HWCA), the Hazardous Waste Facilities Account

This program provides revenue for the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Compliance Fund, which is used to implement, enforce, 
and administer the provisions of the California Cigarette and Tobacco Licensing Act of 2003. The Licensing Act required the 
CDTFA to establish a statewide licensure program to help stem the tide of untaxed distributions and illegal sales of cigarette

implement oil spill prevention programs to implement, install, and maintain emergency programs, equipment, and facilities, to 
respond to, contain, and cleanup oil spills, and to fund the Oiled Wildlife Care Network. OSPA fees are collected on crude oil 
and petroleum products received at California refineries and marine terminals. Effective January 1, 2022, the OSPA fee is also 
collected on renewable fuel received at refineries, marine terminal, and renewable fuel receiving facilities, and on renewable 
fuel shipments from renewable fuel production facilities. The CDTFA administers the program in partnership with the 
Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
6275375 - ENERGY RESOURCES SURCHARGE PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the Energy Resource Surcharge Fund and is used to support the State Energy Resources

partnership with the California Energy Commission. 
6275400 - ANNUAL WATER RIGHTS FEE PROGRAM 
This program provides revenue for the Water Rights Fund. The fees provide funding to the State Water Resources Control

Poisoning Prevention Program, administered by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Childhood Lead Poisoning 
Prevention Branch, which include services such as health care referrals, environmental assessments, and educational activities 
necessary to reduce a child's exposure to lead and the consequences of the exposure. The CDTFA administers the Childhood 
Lead Poisoning Prevention Fee on behalf of the CDPH. The CDTFA collects an annual fee from architectural coatings 
distributors, motor vehicle fuel distributors, and facilities currently reporting releases of lead into ambient air in California. The 
fee is determined by the CDPH based on the feepayers' market share responsibility for environmental lead contamination.

6275550 - LUMBER FEE PROGRAM

law. Therefore, only the Local Charges are being administered.

purpose of the Act is to establish a comprehensive system to control and regulate the cultivation, distribution, transport, 
storage, manufacturing, processing, and sale of all cannabis and cannabis products. The cannabis taxes provide funding for

cannabis.

6275760 - COUNTY REVENUE PROPERTY TAX REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM 
This Program administers the County Revenue Property Tax Reimbursement Program that was created by the passage of 
Proposition 19 on the November 2020 ballot.  CDTFA is responsible for determining each eligible local agency’s aggregate gain 
or loss in property taxes every three years, based on the amounts reported by the counties. Counties with a negative gain are 
eligible to receive a reimbursement from the County Revenue Protection Fund. If the County Revenue Protection Fund is 
insufficient to reimburse all claims, CDTFA is required to allocate available funds based on each local agency’s pro rata share. 
The CDTFA administers the program in partnership with the Franchise Tax Board. 
6275775 - SMALL BUSINESS HIRING CREDIT PROGRAM

administering the personal income tax and the corporation tax. Tax program activities include taxpayer assistance and tax 
return processing, filing enforcement, audits, and tax collection functions. The program also includes the collection and

local candidates, measures committees, lobbying entities, committees supporting and opposing political candidates and 
statewide measures. These entities are randomly selected by the FPPC and/or meet dollar thresholds.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6320 - BUILDING REGULATION SERVICES 
With a multi-billion-dollar annual investment in facilities for state offices and public schools, centralized responsibilities for 
inspection and approval are needed. This is achieved in the following ways: (a) Assuring protection of lives and property in 
public buildings and schools through plan review and field supervision; (b) Ensuring that facilities constructed with state funds 
are accessible to persons with disabilities; (c) Developing uniform public health and safety regulations for state and public 
building construction; (d) Administering the State School Facility Program, which provides financial assistance to school 
districts for the development of schools sites, construction, and modernization or replacement of school buildings; and (e) 
Adopting, codifying and publishing building standards for design and construction throughout California. 
6324 - FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION 
The Facilities Management Division is responsible for maintaining and operating over 60 DGS-owned buildings, grounds, and 
equipment; and supporting a portfolio of over 200 other state-owned properties. 
6325 - REAL ESTATE SERVICES 
Centralized responsibilities for leasing, planning, acquisition, design, and construction are needed to ensure quality, avoid 
redundancy, and deliver real property and facilities at the lowest possible cost. This is achieved by: (a) Providing adequate 
space for state operations at a cost below that which each agency could provide for itself; (b) Ensuring  protection of lives and 
property in public buildings through progressive design and proactive construction inspection; (c) Selecting the most qualified 
parties (both internal and external) to design and construct high quality facilities for other state departments to deliver their 
programs to the citizens of California; and (d) Acquiring, managing, and disposing of real property assets for state agencies, 
and providing public service facilities with economy of operations and uniform practices for protecting the public's interests and 
ensuring equitable treatment of private property owners. 
6330 - STATEWIDE SUPPORT SERVICES 
To fulfill their program responsibilities, state agencies require support services for business transactions and activities which are 
essential to their organizational functions. These operational requirements include: establishing statewide contracts and 
leveraged procurement agreements for information technology and non-information technology goods and services, green and 
sustainable materials, energy/natural gas, and transportation; conducting Non-Competitive Bid reviews/approvals; providing 
small business and disabled veteran business enterprise outreach and certification; setting procurement policy and providing 
the associated training; publishing and related business and office services. Other state agency support requirements include 
travel, consulting services for legal contracts, risk and insurance management services, state-wide sustainability, energy 
efficiency and clean renewable energy generation program services, telework compliance, and budget, accounting, and human 
resources services. Additionally, state, and local agencies contract for the services of administrative law judges to conduct 
quasi-judicial hearings and mediations authorized by law. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration program provides services essential to support the programmatic responsibilities of the Department. This 
program provides executive leadership and policy direction through the executive office, legislative affairs, legal services, 
auditing, research, and strategic planning, public affairs, and equal employment opportunity as well as central administrative 
services in accounting, budgeting, business services, human resources, training, information technology, health and safety, and 
departmental procurement and contracting.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
DGS is responsible for managing approximately 36.9 million square feet of space that supports a variety of state programs and 
functions. Of this amount, 13.1 million net usable square feet is attributable to 59 DGS-managed state office buildings including 
the State Capitol and three new office buildings (Clifford L. Allenby and Natural Resources Agency Headquarters, and the 10th 
and O Street State Office Building); 2.4 million gross square feet related to 24 other state-owned buildings including a new 
childcare facility, warehouses, storage, the Central Heating and Cooling Plant, parking structures, and the State Records 
Warehouse; and 21.4 million net usable square feet is associated with DGS-managed commercial leases of all space types. 
Additionally, the Richards Boulevard Office Complex will add over one million square feet to DGS’s office building portfolio upon 
completion in Spring 2024, at which time it will be added to the Statewide Property Inventory. Finally, DGS has jurisdiction over 
retail and residential properties in downtown Sacramento that the Capitol Area Development Authority manages directly.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6380 - VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
This program reimburses certain expenses of victims of crime in California who are injured or threatened with injury and suffer 
financial hardship as a direct result of a violent crime. The victim of a qualifying crime, and eligible family members, may file a 
claim with the CalVCB for program benefits. 
6385 - RESTITUTION PROGRAM 
This program serves victims of crime in California by maintaining the fiscal stability of the Restitution Fund through the recovery 
of monies owed from restitution fines and orders. The Program's chief emphasis is to educate the criminal justice community 
(the judiciary, district attorneys, chief probation officers, and court administrators) on the importance of the consistent imposition 
and collection of restitution fines and orders. The program also partners with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 
the Franchise Tax Board, and the Attorney General's Office on restitution-related activities. 
6395 - GOOD SAMARITAN PROGRAM 
This program reimburses persons who sustained injury for certain expenses or losses as a result of a direct action that 
benefited the public, such as the prevention of a crime or a rescue of a person in immediate danger of injury or death.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6410 - RETIREMENT 
CalPERS provides retirement planning education, service and disability retirement, refunds, and survivor and death benefits for 
employees of California public employers. CalPERS provides special benefits based on death or disability incurred in the line of 
duty for members in certain occupations. As of June 30, 2023, there were about 1,445,000 active and inactive members, and 
about 789,000 retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries under the CalPERS system. 
Basic retirement benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. 
There are different formulas for each of the member categories, such as Miscellaneous, Industrial, Peace Officer/Firefighter, 
California Highway Patrol, and Safety. Over 50 contract options are available to local cities, counties, and districts that contract 
with CalPERS. However, state and local employees hired after January 1, 2013 will generally be limited to one of five benefit 
formulas. A member's retirement and death benefits are determined by statute and/or contract provisions. 
As of June 30, 2023, there were 2,888 public agency and school district employers providing CalPERS retirement, death, and 
survivor benefits to California public employees. CalPERS benefits may be transferable for members who continue their 
careers with many other public employers in California as a result of agreements between CalPERS and other public agency 
retirement systems. 
CalPERS also administers the Legislators' and Judges' Retirement Systems. 
6412 - SOCIAL SECURITY 
CalPERS serves as California’s designated State Social Security Administrator (SSSA) and oversees agreements between the 
federal government and public employers who provide Social Security benefits to their employees under the Old-Age, 
Survivors, Disability, and Health Insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act. As the SSSA, CalPERS acts as the 
liaison between the Social Security Administration and approximately 2,300 public agencies. The program is responsible for 
administering new coverage agreements, processing coverage modifications, providing education to employers, and collecting 
and reporting information to the Social Security Administration. 
6415 - HEALTH BENEFITS 
The Health Benefits Branch program contracts with health maintenance organizations, claim administrators, employee 
associations, and others to provide health insurance for state, California State University, and local public agency employees, 
retirees, and their dependents. The program negotiates and monitors health plan contracts, develops cost-effective programs, 
provides enrollment services to members and employers, and meets and confers with employee organizations and employer 
representatives. 
Additionally, this program maintains demographic and statistical information systems; establishes standards for Basic, 
Supplement to Medicare, and Managed Medicare health plans; establishes and maintains health benefits coverage for all 
eligible employees and retirees; provides accurate and timely accounting for participating agencies; and serves as an impartial 
intermediary between CalPERS enrollees and insurance carriers in resolving claim and service disputes. 
6420 - INVESTMENT OPERATIONS 
Through this program, CalPERS invests funds in various investment categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) for the 
purpose of minimizing the employers' contributions to the system needed to provide benefits to active participants, retired 
members, and their beneficiaries. Since CalPERS was established in 1932, investment assets of the Public Employees' 
Retirement Fund have grown from $800,000 to a total of $464.6 billion, as of June 30, 2023. 
6425 - ADMINISTRATION 
This program provides executive direction, specialized information, and administrative support necessary to administer all of 
the CalPERS programs. The various services include: Audits, Diversity Outreach, Enterprise Compliance, Enterprise Strategy 
Performance, Executive, Financial Office, Human Resources, Information Technology, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Long Term 
Care, Operational Support, and Public Affairs.

7910   Office of Administrative Law 
The Office of Administrative Law (Office) is responsible for reviewing administrative regulations proposed by over 200 state 
regulatory agencies for compliance with standards set forth in California's Administrative Procedure Act, for transmitting these 
regulations to the Secretary of State, and for publishing regulations in the California Code of Regulations. The Office is also 
responsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been 
recently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through 
a formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative 
Procedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members 
of the public regarding California rulemaking law. 
In response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies 
constitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. 
The Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the 
California Regulatory Notice Register.

7920   State Teachers' Retirement System 
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) administers a defined benefit plan, two defined contribution 
plans, a post-employment benefit plan, and a fund used to account for ancillary activities associated with various deferred 
compensation plans and programs: 
• State Teachers' Retirement Plan (STRP) 
• CalSTRS Pension2 Personal Wealth Plan (Internal Revenue Code 403(b) and 457(b) plans) 
• Teachers' Health Benefits Fund 
• Teachers' Deferred Compensation Fund 
CalSTRS provides pension benefits, including disability and survivor benefits, to California full-time and part-time public school 
teachers from pre-kindergarten through community college and certain other employees of the public school system. As of 
June 30, 2023, there were over one million members, retirees, and beneficiaries in the STRP Defined Benefit Program. 
CalSTRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. The California Constitution provides that the Teachers' Retirement 
Board has authority over the administration of the retirement system.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6450 - SERVICE TO MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS 
CalSTRS is responsible for the determination and payment of benefits to members, retirees, and their beneficiaries, and for the 
distribution of information to all members, employers, and other interested groups. CalSTRS' Defined Benefit Program, the 
largest program within the STRP, includes service retirement, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits. Basic retirement 
benefits are generally based upon three factors: age at retirement, years of service, and final compensation. The member may 
modify the basic allowance by selecting a joint and survivor annuity option to provide benefits for their beneficiary after the 
member dies. Generally, the payments of benefits are made within 30 days following the effective date of the member's 
retirement. A member's retirement benefits, benefits for survivors, and disability benefits are determined by statute and/or 
contract provisions. 
Income to CalSTRS is derived from contributions from members and employing school districts, appropriations from the 
General Fund, and investment earnings (see 6300 - State Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System). The cost of 
administration is paid from the Teachers' Retirement Fund, as provided in Section 22304(a) of the Education Code.
