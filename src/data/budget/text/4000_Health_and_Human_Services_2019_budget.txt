PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3835 - HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE 
The Health Care Workforce Program, through the Health Care Workforce Development Division and the Health Professions 
Education Foundation, improves access to medical, mental, and dental health care providers in underserved areas throughout 
California. The Program conducts research to identify areas of unmet need and administers grants that provide financial 
incentives to individuals and institutions to increase the number of providers in those areas. The Program promotes health care 
workforce diversity and cultural competency. It includes the following programs: 
• Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Program

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
• Mental Health Services Act Workforce Education and Training Program 
• California State Loan Repayment Program 
• Health Care Workforce Clearinghouse Program 
• Health Professions Career Opportunity Training Program 
• Health Workforce Pilot Projects Program 
• Shortage Designation Program 
• Health Professions Education Foundation Programs 
3840 - FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT 
The Facilities Development Program safeguards public health, safety, and general welfare through regulation of the design and 
construction of health care facilities, including compliance with seismic safety requirements, to ensure they are capable of 
providing sustained services to the public. 
3845 - CAL-MORTGAGE LOAN INSURANCE 
The Cal-Mortgage Program is modeled after federal home mortgage insurance programs and insures loans to public and 
nonprofit health care facilities for construction, renovation, and expansion projects. The Program underwrites loans, monitors 
the Cal-Mortgage insured loan portfolio, and administers the Health Facility Construction Loan Insurance Fund. By facilitating 
access to private capital at no cost to taxpayers, the Program has improved the delivery of health care throughout California. 
3855 - HEALTH CARE INFORMATION AND QUALITY ANALYSIS 
The Health Care Information Program sets standards for, collects, and maintains financial and utilization data from 
approximately 6,000 licensed health facilities in California, as well as comprehensive demographic, diagnostic, and treatment 
data for all patients discharged from licensed hospitals, treated in emergency departments, or having had an ambulatory 
surgery procedure in hospital surgical clinics. This information is used by health care policymakers, health care providers, 
health planners, public and private sector health care purchasers, researchers, consumers, and the media. To further this 
mission, the Health Care Information Program is implementing new health care cost transparency data programs to collect and 
analyze prescription drug cost data and health care payment data to improve transparency, inform policy decisions, reduce 
disparities, and reduce health care costs. 
3860 - ADMINISTRATION 
Administration provides overall management, planning, policy development, legal, legislative, information technology support 
and administrative services to OSHPD.

Advocacy Program. The Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs: it contracts directly with agencies that operate 
the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and provides oversight for the MSSP waiver, and certifies Community-
Based Adult Services centers for participation in Medicaid. 
The Department administers most of these programs through contracts with the state's 33 local Area Agencies on Aging. At the 
local level, Area Agencies on Aging contract for and coordinate this array of community-based services to older adults, adults 
with disabilities, family caregivers, and residents of long-term care facilities.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Senior Nutrition Program—The Budget includes $17.5 million General Fund for the Senior Nutrition program, which provides 
meals to seniors in both congregate and home-delivered settings. The increased funding for the program will be suspended 
on December 31, 2021. The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process 
that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal years.

three years of supplemental provider payments for Multipurpose Senior Services Program providers. 
• Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program—The Budget includes $4.2 million General Fund in 2019-20 and $5.2 million 
General Fund annually thereafter for local Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs to provide quarterly visits to skilled 
nursing facilities and residential care facilities for the elderly. 
• Aging and Disability Resource Connection Grants—The Budget includes $5 million General Fund to provide grants to local 
Area Agencies on Aging and Independent Living Centers to complete the planning and application process to become Aging 
and Disability Resource Connections, which utilize the “No Wrong Door” model. The increased funding for grants will be 
suspended on December 31, 2021. The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget 
Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal 
years. 
• Dignity at Home Fall Prevention Program—The Budget includes $5 million General Fund one-time to provide grants to local

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3890 - NUTRITION 
The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally-balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60 
years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the 
isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and 
assistance, employment, and education. 
3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 
The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized 
training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also 
promotes transition to unsubsidized employment. 
3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 
This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers, 
grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance, 
legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term 
Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support 
necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care 
services appropriate to their needs. 
3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 
This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides 
personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local 
source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans. 
3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services 
(CBAS) program. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to adults 18 years of age or over who 
are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health conditions and/or disabilities. The 
Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-
based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term 
care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility.

4265   Department of Public Health 
The California Department of Public Health (Public Health) is dedicated to optimizing the health and well-being of all 
Californians through the following core activities: 
• Protecting the public from communicable diseases. 
• Protecting the public from unhealthy and unsafe environments. 
• Preventing disease, disability, and premature death; and reducing or eliminating health disparities. 
• Preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. 
• Producing and disseminating data to evaluate population health status; inform people, institutions and communities; and to 
guide public health strategies, programs, and actions. 
• Promoting healthy lifestyles for individuals and families in their communities and workplaces. 
• Providing access to quality, population-based health services. 
Because Public Health's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program to 
support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

4300   Department of Developmental Services 
The Department of Developmental Services is responsible under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act for 
providing persons with developmental disabilities the services and supports they need to lead more independent and 
productive lives and to make choices and decisions about their lives. The Department sets broad policy and provides 
leadership for developmental services statewide; establishes priorities, standards, and procedures within which the 
developmental services program operates; monitors, reviews, and evaluates service delivery; and helps to remediate problems 
that arise. Services are delivered through a statewide network of 21 private, nonprofit, locally based community agencies 
known as regional centers as well as through developmental centers and a state-operated community facility. The Department, 
through the 21 regional centers, oversees coordination of services to persons with developmental disabilities; provides that 
such services are planned, provided, and meet the needs and choices of these individuals at each stage of their lives; and, to 
the extent possible, accomplishes these goals in the individual's home community. 
The Department has a capital outlay program to support its state operated facilities and the infrastructure investment. For the 
specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Supplemental Rate Increases and Developmental Services System Accountability and Oversight—The Budget includes 
$206.7 million ($125 million General Fund) in 2019-20 and $413.3 million ($250 million General Fund) in 2020-21 to provide 
supplemental rate increases to providers across a broad array of service categories. The increased funding provides a 
broad-based increase of up to 8.2 percent for service categories identified in the developmental services rate study 
submitted to the Legislature in March 2019. The increased funding for developmental services provider rates will be 
suspended on December 31, 2021. The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget 
Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal 
years. 
• Headquarters Restructure and Reorganization—The Budget includes $8.1 million ($6.5 million General Fund) ongoing for a 
reorganization of departmental headquarters to strengthen oversight and monitoring of regional centers and provider 
operations and enhance program compliance. 
• Uniform Holiday Schedule Suspension—The Budget includes $50.3 million ($30.1 million General Fund) in 2019-20 to 
suspend implementation of the Uniform Holiday Schedule. The increased funding will be suspended on December 31, 2021. 
The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient 
General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal years. 
• Acute and Mobile Crisis Services—The Budget includes $5.3 million ($4.8 million General Fund) and $7.9 million ($4.7 
million General Fund) annually thereafter to expand crisis services to the Central Valley. 
• Development of Community Crisis Homes for Children—The Budget includes $4.5 million one-time General Fund to develop 
community crisis housing specifically for children. 
• Specialized Home Monitoring—The Budget includes $5.8 million ($3.9 million General Fund) ongoing to increase monitoring 
of Enhanced Behavioral Support Homes and Community Crisis Homes. 
• Specialized Caseload Ratios—The Budget includes $3.8 million ($2.6 million General Fund) ongoing to establish a reduced 
regional center service coordinator caseload ratio for consumers with specialized behavioral needs. 
• Best Buddies—The Budget includes $2 million General Fund to support social inclusion, integrated employment, and 
leadership program services for children and adults with developmental disabilities, and will include a report of the number of 
persons served annually with these funds.

care. Canyon Springs operates as an intermediate care facility, and STAR residences operate as community crisis homes. 
Services at all facilities involve the provision of active treatment through residential and day programs on a 24-hour basis, 
including appropriate medical and dental care, health maintenance activities, and assistance with activities of daily living, 
training, education, and employment. 
Individuals served in the STAR crisis residences are committed by a court order to the Department for suitable treatment and 
habilitation services during a crisis, and are provided services and supports necessary to prepare them for return to their 
residential home or to transition to a new living option. The primary objective of this program is to provide a safety net of 
services that include providing care, treatment, crisis services, and habilitation services to residents based upon assessed 
need and as outlined in each person's Individual Program Plan. These services are offered in the most efficient, effective, and 
least restrictive manner to all individuals referred by the regional centers and/or the judicial system; and are designed to teach 
individuals the skills for increased independence, provide for preservation or improvement of health and welfare, and enhance 
personal competence in all areas of daily living. 
Fairview Developmental Center and the non-secure treatment portion of Porterville Developmental Center are scheduled for 
closure no later than 2021.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Department of Developmental Services is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facilities under its control, 
including three state-owned and operated 24-hour care facilities and related buildings, grounds, and infrastructure. The facilities 
are Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County, Porterville Developmental Center in Tulare County, and Sonoma 
Developmental Center in Sonoma County. The developmental centers are comprised of approximately 3.6 million gross square 
feet in 437 buildings on 1,647 acres in total. As of December 2018, Sonoma Developmental Center in Sonoma County had 
transitioned all former residents to community living.  The Department will continue to maintain the property until June 30, 
2019.  In addition, the Department operates one residence, and will develop six more, for the Stabilization, Training, 
Assistance, and Reintegration beds that provide acute crisis services in the community. The Department is also responsible for 
the maintenance of interior finishes and equipment at a 57,000 square foot-leased facility in Riverside County. These facilities 
are used to aid the Department's mission to provide medical, dental, and nursing care; active treatment; supervision; education; 
and vocational training for residents with developmental disabilities.

4440   Department of State Hospitals 
The Department of State Hospitals manages the nation's largest inpatient forensic mental health hospital system. Its mission is 
to provide evaluation and treatment in a safe and responsible manner, seeking innovation and excellence in state hospital 
operations, across a continuum of care. The Department is responsible for the daily care and provision of mental health 
treatment for its patients in five state hospitals located in Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan-Los Angeles, Napa, and 
Patton, and employs over 11,000 staff. Additionally, the Department provides services in jail-based competency treatment 
programs and conditional release programs throughout the 58 counties. In 2017-18, the Department served approximately 
12,000 patients within state hospitals and jail-based facilities, with average daily censuses of 5,897 and 227 respectively. The 
conditional release program (CONREP) reflected an average daily census of approximately 654. 
Because the Department of State Hospitals' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Metropolitan State Hospital Bed Expansion—The Budget includes $15.5 million General Fund and 99.2 positions for the 
second and final expansion phase of the Metropolitan State Hospital’s secured treatment area.  When completed in 2019, a 
total of 236 additional secured forensic beds will be available for the treatment of incompetent to stand trial commitments. 
• Mission-Based Review: Direct Care Nursing—The Budget includes $15 million General Fund and 117.3 positions for the first 
year of a three-year phase-in to staff 128 medication rooms and to provide nighttime nursing supervisors in units across the 
five state hospitals. This will increase the number of direct-care nursing staffing in an effort to reduce patient violence, staff 
injuries, and staff turnover and absenteeism. In addition, the Budget includes 304 positions to better reflect the State 
Hospital's usage of temporary help staff.  
• Jail-Based Competency Treatment Programs—The Budget includes $6.4 million General Fund to contract for up to 73 
additional jail-based competency restoration treatment beds through both existing and new county jail treatment programs. 
• Patient-Driven Operating Expenses—The Budget includes $11 million General Fund for increased patient-driven operating 
expenses and equipment costs, such as pharmaceuticals, outside medical costs, and food. In addition, the Budget includes 
a standard estimate methodology for determining State Hospital patient operating expenses and equipment needs, which is 
being applied beginning in 2019-20. 
• Mission-Based Review: Court Evaluations and Reports—The Budget includes $8.1 million General Fund and 43 positions for 
the first year of a three-year phase-in of additional staff dedicated to forensic evaluations, court reports and testimony, court 
report coordination, and neuropsychological assessments and treatment. These dedicated staff will result in consistent 
evaluations and reports statewide, and reduce the amount of time treating clinicians spend in court, enabling them to focus 
on patient treatment. 
• Mission-Based Review: Workforce Development—The Budget includes $1.8 million total fund and 8 positions to: (1) expand 
partnerships with community colleges to increase capacity in existing Psychiatric Technician training programs, and (2) 
establish a Forensic Psychiatry Residency program at Napa State Hospital. 
• Conditional Release Step Down Program—An increase of $5.7 million General Fund in 2019-20 ($11.5 million General Fund 
annually thereafter) for the Department of State Hospitals to contract for a 78-bed community step-down program to serve 
Mentally Disordered Offenders and Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity commitments who are preparing for conditional release 
from state hospitals within 18 to 24 months. This funding also includes increasing an existing Department of State Hospitals’ 
contract by 4 beds. 
• Telepsychiatry Resources—An increase of $2.2 million General Fund in 2019-20 ($3.7 million General Fund in 2020-21 and 
$3.5 million General Fund annually thereafter) for the Department of State Hospitals to expand the use of telepsychiatry to 
treat patients remotely via video-conferencing.

2003, conditional release providers did not have treatment services that would allow them to accept sexually violent predators 
as patients, requiring the Department of State Hospitals to enter into an annual contract with a single private provider serving 
58 counties. Current statue requires the sexually violent predators be conditionally released to their county of domicile and 
sufficient funding be available to provide treatment and supervision services when a sexually violent predator is conditionally 
released into the community by court order.

of state hospital facilities. This includes both the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County as well as 
various other jail-based competency treatment programs. 
4430010 - ADMISSION, EVALUATION, STABILIZATION CENTER 
The Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center in the Kern County Jail receives incompetent to stand trial patients 
committed to the Department of State Hospitals directly from catchment counties in southern California. Patients receive a full 
evaluation upon admission to determine whether they can be treated through the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization 
Center on a short-term basis or may need longer-term state hospital treatment. Patients considered to be short-term can be 
treated and discharged directly from the Admissions, Evaluation, and Stabilization Center. 
4430020 - JAIL-BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT

Programs. Penal Code Sections 2960-2981 require that a prisoner who meets specific criteria be ordered by the Board of 
Parole Hearings to be treated by State Hospitals as a condition of parole. The Department of State Hospitals performs 
evaluations to determine if individuals may meet the statutory criteria for the Mentally Disordered Offender program. These 
evaluations are used by the Board of Parole Hearings in determining whether a prisoner is committed to the Department of 
State Hospitals as a condition of parole. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 6600 et seq. (Chapter 793, Statutes of 1995) 
was enacted January 1, 1996, establishing a new category of civil commitment for persons found, upon release from prison, to 
be sexually violent predators. The Sex Offender Commitment Program administers clinical screenings and performs 
evaluations to determine if prisoners may meet the statutory criteria for a sexually violent predator commitment to the 
Department of State Hospitals upon completion of their prison term. Superior Courts make the ultimate determination whether 
an individual is likely to be a sexually violent predator and warrants forensic psychological evaluations by the Department of 
State Hospitals.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS 
The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through 
financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization and renewable energy services. 
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households 
to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related 
emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard 
the health and safety of household occupants. This program may include a leveraging incentive program in which 
supplementary LIHEAP funds can be obtained by LIHEAP grantees if non-federal leveraged home energy resources are used 
along with LIHEAP weatherization related services. 
The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-
income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides weatherization and renewable energy services in low-income 
single-family and multi-family dwellings within disadvantaged communities to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LIWP 
includes projects such as weatherization and solar water heater and solar photovoltaic systems installations. 
4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES 
The Community Services Block Grant is designed to enable local government and private nonprofit community organizations to 
help low-income families achieve and maintain self-sufficiency through a broad range of activities. These activities include 
education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional 
services. Additionally, Community Services Block Grant funds are used by local community organizations to revitalize low-
income communities. 
The California Earned Income Tax Credit (Cal EITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax 
credits to boost the income of eligible families. In 2017-18 and 2018-19, CSD has worked with the Franchise Tax Board and 
non-profit and community-based organizations to increase awareness of the Cal EITC and provide free tax preparation 
assistance to Californians.

consumers. The Department operates under a federal Order of Selection process, which gives priority to persons with the most 
significant disabilities. 
Persons with disabilities who are eligible for the Department's vocational rehabilitation services may be provided a full range of 
services, including vocational assessment, assistive technology, vocational and educational training, job placement, and 
independent living skills training to maximize their ability to live and work independently within their communities. 
The Department provides comprehensive training and technical assistance to enable persons who are blind or visually 
impaired to support themselves in the operation of vending stands, snack bars, and cafeterias. Prevocational services are 
provided by the Orientation Center for the Blind to newly blind adults to prepare them for vocational rehabilitation services and 
independent living. 
The Department works with public and private organizations to develop and improve community-based vocational rehabilitation 
services for the Department's consumers. The Department sets standards, certifies Community Rehabilitation Programs, and 
establishes fees for services provided to its consumers. 
The Department works with the federal government to administer two grant programs. The Promoting the Readiness of Minors 
in Supplemental Security Income grant develops projects to promote positive outcomes for children who receive Supplemental 
Security Income and their families. The CA Innovations Program seeks to increase the self-sufficiency of students with 
disabilities by providing work-based learning experiences and planned education to prepare them for workplace success. 
4215 - INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES 
The Department funds, administers, and supports 28 non-profit independent living centers in communities located throughout 
California. Each independent living center provides services necessary to assist consumers to live independently with full 
inclusion in their communities. Core services consist of information and referral, peer counseling, individual and systems 
change advocacy, independent living skills, housing assistance, personal assistance referral services, transition and diversion 
services to community based living, and transition services to postsecondary life for youth. 
The Department administers and supports the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program. In coordination with consumers and their 
families, seven service providers throughout California provide a coordinated post-acute care service model for persons with 
TBI, including supported living, community reintegration, vocational supportive services, public awareness, and support for 
family, friends, and professionals within the TBI community. 
The Department administers the federal Older Individuals Who Are Blind program that supports 19 non-profit community-based 
organizations throughout California that provide blindness-related independent living services necessary to assist visually 
impaired consumers age 55 or older to live independently and be productive in their communities. Core services consist of low 
vision training, assistive technology devices and training, orientation and mobility, communication skills, independent living 
skills development, self-advocacy, adjustment counseling, transportation, and supportive services. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The Administration Program provides overall management planning, policy development, and administrative support services 
to departmental programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4250 - STATE COUNCIL SERVICES 
The State Independent Living Council, in conjunction with the Department of Rehabilitation, is responsible for developing a 
state plan for independent living and for monitoring, reviewing and evaluating the implementation of that plan. The Council also 
interacts with similar statewide councils to enhance the effectiveness of the network of centers that provide independent living 
services in California. The Council is required by the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, in order for the state to 
receive financial assistance for Independent Living Services and the Centers for Independent Living. The Council serves as an 
educational resource on disability and independent living for the Governor, other state agencies, the Legislature, the general 
public, and a variety of statewide and national organizations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4260 - CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM 
The Child Support Services program establishes the system and process for encouraging and, when necessary, enforcing 
parental responsibilities by establishing paternity for children, establishing court orders for financial and medical support, and 
enforcing those orders. The program operates as the single state entity designed to administer the federally mandated Title IV-
D child support program in California. Operation of this program is required for the state to continue to receive the Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families block grant. 
4260010 - CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION: 
The Child Support Administration program provides funding for the salaries and benefits for local and state staff, and operating 
expenses and equipment for the operation of California's child support program, including local child support agencies. The 
federal government provides 66 percent of the funding and the state funds 34 percent of the administration costs. 
4260019 - CHILD SUPPORT AUTOMATION: 
Pursuant to Federal law, the Department created a single, statewide child support automation system that meets federal 
certification. There are two components of the statewide system: the Child Support Enforcement system and the State 
Disbursement Unit. The enforcement system provides local child support staff tools to manage child support customer accounts 
and locate and intercept assets of non-custodial parents delinquent in their child support payments. The Child Support 
Automation program provides funding for the vendor-operated state disbursement unit, which collects child support payments 
from non-custodial parents and disburses payments to custodial parties. In addition, the Child Support Automation program 
provides funding for electronic data processing maintenance and operation costs at local agencies.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• CalWORKs Maximum Aid Payment (MAP) Increase—The Budget includes $331.5 million General Fund and federal 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds in 2019-20 and $441.8 million ongoing to increase 
CalWORKs MAP levels, effective October 1, 2019. 
• Update the CalWORKs Earned Income Disregard and Income Reporting Threshold—The Budget includes $6.8 million 
General Fund in 2019-20 growing to $99 million General Fund ongoing beginning in 2022-23, to increase the current 
CalWORKs Earned Income Disregard using a phased approach, from the current $225 per month in 2019-20 to $600 per 
month in 2021-22. The Budget also aligns the CalWORKs Income Reporting Threshold with the CalFresh program at 130 
percent of the federal poverty level beginning in 2019-20. 
• Increase CalWORKs Asset Test Limits—Increases the CalWORKs eligibility limit on cash assets from $2,250 to $10,000 and 
the vehicle asset limit from $9,500 to $25,000 for purposes of program eligibility, effective June 1, 2020. The revised asset 
limit levels will be adjusted annually for inflation. The Budget includes $7.5 million General Fund in 2019-20 to reflect the 
increased limits. Costs are estimated to be $29.9 million General Fund ongoing beginning in 2021-22. 
• Elimination of Consecutive Day Use Requirement in the CalWORKs Homeless Assistance Program (HAP)—The Budget 
includes $14.7 million General Fund in 2019-20 and $27.6 million ongoing General Fund to eliminate the requirement that 
the 16 allowable days of CalWORKs temporary homeless assistance be used consecutively in a year-long period. 
• CalWORKs Home Visiting Program—The Budget includes $89.6 million General Fund and federal TANF block grant funds in 
2019-20 and approximately $167 million ongoing for the CalWORKs Home Visiting Program. 
• CalWORKs Single Allocation Budgeting Methodology—The Budget includes $41.4 million General Fund and federal TANF 
block grant funds in 2019-20 to reflect the adoption of a revised budgeting methodology for the employment services 
component of the CalWORKs Single Allocation to counties. Additionally, beginning in 2020-21, the Single Allocation will no 
longer include the Stage One Child Care component. Stage One will be budgeted separately within the CalWORKs program. 
• CalWORKs Outcomes and Accountability Review (Cal-OAR)—The Budget includes $13.2 million General Fund and federal 
TANF block grant funds in 2019-20 for counties to perform required continuous quality improvement activities consistent with 
Cal-OAR implementation. 
• CalWORKs Stage One Child Care—The Budget includes $56.4 million General Fund in 2019-20 and $70.5 million ongoing 
General Fund to improve access to and utilization of CalWORKs Stage One child care services. 
• Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Cash-Out Policy Reversal Adjustments—The Budget preserves ongoing funding for 
county administration and benefits for newly eligible CalFresh recipients, Supplemental Nutrition Benefit program recipients, 
Transitional Nutrition Benefit program recipients, and California Assistance Program for Immigrants program recipients as a 
result of expanding CalFresh eligibility to SSI recipients, effective June 1, 2019. The Budget includes $120 million General 
Fund in 2019-20 and approximately $115 million annually thereafter to fund these programs on an ongoing basis. 
• SSI Advocacy—The Budget includes $25 million General Fund ongoing for the Housing and Disability Advocacy Program, to 
assist homeless, disabled individuals in applying for disability benefit programs. 
• IHSS Restoration—The Budget includes $357.6 million General Fund in 2019-20 to restore the 7-percent across-the-board 
reduction to IHSS service hours. The increased funding for IHSS service hours will be suspended on December 31, 2021. 
The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient 
General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the subsequent two fiscal years. 
• County IHSS Maintenance-of-Effort Adjustment—The Budget includes an increase of $296.8 million General Fund in 
2019-20 to rebench the County IHSS Maintenance-of-Effort, growing to $615.3 million General Fund in 2022-23. 
• Electronic Visit Verification—The Budget includes $37.5 million ($6.4 million General Fund) in 2019-20 to comply with the 
federal electronic visit verification mandate and make necessary changes to the Case Management, Information and 
Payrolling System.  
• IHSS County Administration—The Budget includes an ongoing increase of $15.4 million General Fund for IHSS county 
administration to reflect revised benefit rate assumptions. 
• Federal Title IV-E Funds for Dependency Counsel—The Budget includes $34 million ongoing federal funds to support court-
appointed dependency counsel representing children and parents during dependency proceedings. 
• Foster Care Emergency Assistance—The Budget includes $25.8 million one-time General Fund and federal TANF block

grant funds in 2019-20 to provide caregivers with up to four months of emergency assistance payments pending resource 
family approval and up to twelve months for cases that meet good cause criteria. Beginning in 2020-21 and annually 
thereafter, the State will fund emergency assistance payments for up to three months, as local child welfare agencies and 
probation departments are anticipated to complete the resource family approval process on a timelier basis. 
• Resource Family Approval Administration and Application Backlog—The Budget includes $14.4 million one-time General 
Fund in 2019-20 to support county efforts in eliminating the backlog of foster care resource family applications that are 
pending review and approval.  
• Family Urgent Response System—The Budget includes $15 million General Fund in 2019-20 and $30 million General Fund 
annually thereafter to implement a statewide hotline and enhanced county-based mobile response systems targeting youth 
in foster care and their caregivers. The system is intended to prevent placement disruptions, reduce traumatic experiences 
for foster youth, and reduce law enforcement calls and needless criminalization of youth. The increased funding for Family 
Urgent Response will be suspended on December 31, 2021. The suspension will be lifted if the Administration determines 
through the 2021 Budget Act process that there is sufficient General Fund revenue to support all suspended programs in the 
subsequent two fiscal years. 
• Foster Parent Recruitment, Retention, and Support—The Budget includes $21.6 million one-time General Fund in 2019-20 
for activities and services to retain, recruit, and support foster parents, relative caregivers, and resource families.  
• Emergency Child Care Bridge—The Budget includes an increase of $10 million General Fund for the Emergency Child Care 
Bridge program. 
• Bringing Families Home—The Budget includes $25 million one-time General Fund, available over three years, for the 
Bringing Families Home Program, which is a county-optional program that provides housing-related supports to eligible 
families served by county child welfare agencies.  
• Immigration Services—The Budget includes a total of $65 million ongoing General Fund to support qualified nonprofit 
organizations that provide a broad array of legal services and remedies related to immigration status for individuals and 
families. Of this amount, the Budget allows for up to $5 million General Fund, on a one-time basis, to be available for the 
provision of legal services to unaccompanied undocumented minors and Temporary Protected Status beneficiaries, and $7 
million ongoing General Fund will be used to support persons on California State University campuses. Additionally, the 
Budget includes $25 million one-time General Fund for the Rapid Response Program to support entities that provide critical 
assistance/services to immigrants during emergent situations when federal funding is not available.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4270 - WELFARE PROGRAMS 
The Department's public assistance programs provide financial assistance to California residents who are unable to support 
themselves. These programs are comprised of five components: 
• California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) 
• Other Assistance Payments, including Foster Care, Adoption Assistance Program, Refugee Cash Assistance, and Food 
Assistance Programs 
• Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program 
• County Administration and Automation Projects 
• Disaster Relief 
The objectives of these programs are to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible needy and dependent persons to 
enable achievement of self-sufficiency or to provide safe living environments for vulnerable adults and children, and to monitor, 
administer, and improve the quality of all welfare services. 
4270010 - CalWORKs: 
The CalWORKs program is California's version of the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. CalWORKs is 
California's largest cash aid program for children and families and is designed to provide temporary assistance to meet basic 
needs, such as shelter, food, and clothing, in times of crisis, while encouraging personal responsibility. CalWORKs includes 
specific welfare-to-work requirements and provides supportive services, such as child care, to enable an individual to meet 
these requirements. Child care services currently are provided through a three-stage system to current and former CalWORKs 
recipients with children through the age of 10 (or up to 12 under certain conditions). Stage One is administered by the 
Department of Social Services. Stages Two and Three are administered by the California Department of Education. Parents 
have the right to choose child care among center-based, family child care homes, or license-exempt providers. CalWORKs 
families are then able to meet both goals of moving from welfare into the work force and engaging children in child care and 
development services. 
4270019 - Other Assistance Payments: 
The Foster Care program provides assistance payments to relatives, foster family homes, foster family agencies, short-term 
residential treatment centers or group homes for children who have been removed from the custody of a parent or guardian as 
a result of a judicial order or voluntary placement agreement due to findings of abuse, neglect or exploitation. This program is 
administered by the counties in accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social 
Services as authorized by federal and state law. The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program provides support payments to 
relative guardians of children who were previously in the foster care system. 
The Adoption Assistance Program provides financial assistance to families adopting a child with special needs or to facilitate 
the adoption of children who otherwise would remain in long-term foster care. This program is administered by the counties in 
accordance with regulations, standards, and procedures set by the Department of Social Services as authorized by federal and 
state law. 
California also provides cash assistance to eligible refugee/entrant populations via the following programs: 
• The Refugee Cash Assistance provides cash grants to refugees/entrants in their first eight months in the United States 
provided they are not otherwise eligible for categorical welfare programs. 
• The Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate child welfare, foster care, and 
independent living services to minors who do not have parents in the United States, or who enter the United States 
unaccompanied by a parent, an immediate adult relative, or an adult having documentable legal evidence of custody of the 
minor. 
• The Trafficking and Crime Victims Assistance Program provides cash aid and social services to noncitizen victims of human 
trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes who meet the income and eligibility requirements. Benefits are 
available for a maximum period of eight months for adults without children and up to 48 months for families (under 
CalWORKs). 
The CalFresh Program, federally referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides improved levels of 
nutrition among eligible low-income households by offering them a benefit amount, posted to a debit card, for the purpose of 
purchasing food. The cost of CalFresh benefits is provided by the United States Department of Agriculture for populations

eligible to receive federal benefits. Legal immigrants who meet program eligibility criteria but are ineligible for federal benefits 
due to their immigration status are served under the state-funded program known as the California Food Assistance Program. 
The CalFresh Employment and Training Program requires certain non-assistance CalFresh recipients to participate in 
employment and training activities. 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides commodities to local food banks in all 58 California counties for distribution 
to the working poor, low-income, unemployed, and homeless persons. The food is distributed to eligible recipients for 
household consumption or used to prepare and serve meals in congregate settings. This program is also supplemented with 
food purchased by food banks using private donations, funds provided by the state, taxpayer contributions generated through a 
state income tax check-off, as well as surplus fresh fruits and vegetables donated by farmers and businesses. 
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is a federally funded program for local non-profit agencies to provide nutritious 
supplemental foods to low-income, elderly people at least 60 years of age. Administrative responsibility for the Commodity 
Supplemental Food Program was transferred from the California Department of Education to the Department of Social Services 
on October 1, 2016. 
4270028 - Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment Program: 
The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a cash assistance program for low-income aged, blind, or disabled 
persons who meet the program's income and resource requirements. California supplements the federal SSI payment with a 
State Supplementary Payment (SSP). The SSI/SSP program is administered by the federal Social Security Administration who 
determines eligibility, computes grants, and disburses the combined monthly payment to recipients. 
4270037 - County Administration and Automation Projects: 
Federal, state, and county governments share the cost of operating expenses and the salaries and benefits of county staff who 
administer public assistance programs. 
Federal, state, and county funds are used to finance major data automation projects of the Department of Social Services. 
4270046 - Disaster Relief: 
The objective of the Disaster Relief Program is to provide monetary assistance to individuals and households who have 
suffered eligible losses from a Presidentially-declared disaster that are not covered by other federal, state, or private assistance 
programs. 
4275 - SOCIAL SERVICES AND LICENSING 
The Department of Social Services oversees and monitors the administration of social services programs, which include child 
welfare, adoptions, licensing and special programs. The department is responsible for development of policy, regulations, and 
procedures that govern the delivery of services to children, families and other recipients, and the monitoring and evaluation of 
the service delivery system. 
4275010 - In-Home Supportive Services: 
The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program provides in-home services that enable eligible individuals to remain safely in 
their own homes as an alternative to out-of-home care. Eligible persons are low-income aged, blind, or disabled individuals who 
either qualify for federally funded Medi-Cal or meet the program's income and resource requirements. There are four programs 
that provide in-home care: the Personal Care Services Program, IHSS Plus Option Program, Community First Choice Option, 
and IHSS-Residual Program. 
4275019 - Children and Adult Services and Licensing: 
The Children's Services component consists of three major areas: Child Welfare Services, Adoptions, and Child Abuse 
Prevention. 
Child Welfare Services provides emergency response, family maintenance, family reunification, and permanent placement and 
prevention services to protect abused, neglected or exploited children. The services are provided through an integrated 
services delivery system that provides intensive services to families to promote child safety, permanency and well-being with 
the goal of allowing families to stay together in their own homes, or arrangement for the child's placement in the safest and 
least restrictive home-like setting. Services also include assistance to youth who are emancipating or have emancipated from 
foster care. The program also provides training and technical assistance to county administrators and staff. 
In Child Welfare Services, the Department of Social Services is implementing continuum of care reforms codified in Chapter 
773, Statutes of 2015. The reforms emphasize home-based family care, improve access to services without having to change 
out-of-home placements to get those services, and increase the role of children, youth, and families in assessment and case 
planning.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Adoptions Program provides support services to children and adoptive families through a collaboration of public and 
private adoption agencies in the state. Agency adoptions provide adoption services through public and private agencies for 
children who have been abused, neglected or exploited and are under the jurisdiction of the county or tribal court. Services 
include adoptive placement screening; home studies; reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for adoptive parents; 
training, recruitment and retention of foster parents; and technical assistance and support for inter-country adoptions. For 
independent adoptions, the public agency investigates a proposed adoption and provides a report to the court when the 
biological parents place their children directly with adoptive parents of their choice. 
The Child Abuse Prevention Program provides funding, training, and technical assistance for the development and 
sustainability of child abuse prevention and early intervention programs, education and outreach materials, activities, and 
services for at risk families and their children. 
The Adult Protective Services program provides funding for counties to address reports of physical and financial abuse and 
neglect or exploitation of elder or dependent adults and provide intervention, as necessary. 
The Community Care Licensing Program is a regulatory enforcement program with the responsibility of protecting the health 
and safety of children and adults residing in or spending a portion of their time in out-of-home care. The program includes 
facility licensure, prevention, compliance, and enforcement components. 
4275028 - Special Programs: 
The Special Programs provides funds for Foster Care Burial, Assistance Dog Special Allowance, Access Assistance to the 
Deaf, Refugee Programs, Immigration and Naturalization Assistance Services and Legal Services for Unaccompanied and 
Undocumented Minors. 
4280 - TITLE IV-E WAIVER 
The Title IV-E California Child Well-Being Project is a federal waiver demonstration project in California. This project provides 
participating counties with a capped federal grant that in turn provides flexibility in the use of federal and state foster care 
maintenance and administrative funds on program and services expenditures that were previously unallowable. 
4285 - DISABILITY EVALUATION AND OTHER SERVICES 
The objective of this program is to determine an applicant's medical and/or vocational eligibility for disability benefits and 
provide administrative services to other agencies. 
4285010 - Disability Evaluation: 
The Disability Evaluation Program determines the medical, vocational, and/or functional eligibility of California residents 
applying for benefits under Title II (Disability Insurance), Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income), and Title XIX (Medicaid) of 
the Social Security Act. Eligibility is determined by the severity of the individual's physical and/or mental impairment(s) and 
overall ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. 
4285019 - Services to Other Agencies: 
In addition to providing support services for its programs, the Department of Social Services provides general administrative 
services, such as personnel and accounting to the State Council on Developmental Disabilities and the Health and Human 
Services Agency. The Department provides services to the Medi-Cal Program in the form of state hearings and public 
information services. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and 
administrative support services to other departmental programs.

5195   State-Local Realignment, 1991 
In the 1991-92 fiscal year, State-Local Program Realignment restructured the state-county partnership by giving counties 
increased responsibilities and funding for a number of health, mental health, and social services programs. This realignment 
provides counties with dedicated tax revenues from the state sales tax and vehicle license fee to pay for these programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4350 - STATE-LOCAL REALIGNMENT 
The objectives of Realignment are to assign program responsibility to the most appropriate level of government and achieve 
improved service levels with broad discretion given to the responsible entity. Realignment provides for greater funding stability 
for selected programs, increased local flexibility in administering these programs, and productive fiscal incentives to encourage 
cost-effective approaches to providing services. 
Total Realignment revenues are comprised of a half cent sales tax and a dedicated portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund, which includes several accounts. Funds deposited in these accounts 
are continuously appropriated for allocation to local governments according to formula and are used to fund programs specified 
in realignment legislation. The legislation also includes local maintenance of effort and matching requirements in order to 
ensure that counties do not use the realigned funds to supplant local expenditure levels prior to realignment. This provision 
ensures compliance with other state and federal statutes which, in turn, provide hundreds of millions of dollars annually for 
county health and social services programs.

5196   2011 State-Local Realignment 
Building upon the 1991-92 Realignment, 2011 Realignment moves program and fiscal responsibility to counties, providing a 
dedicated source of funding while eliminating duplication of effort, generating savings, and increasing flexibility. 
Realigned programs include local public safety programs, mental health, substance abuse, foster care, child welfare services, 
and adult protective services. Many of these programs are already administered at the local level by counties. Therefore, it is 
appropriate for the programmatic and fiscal responsibility to reside with the counties with the state maintaining an oversight and 
technical assistance role where needed. These changes are made with the goal of providing services more efficiently and at 
less cost. 
The funding sources for realignment are: 
• The dedication of 1.0625 cents of a state special fund sales tax. 
• The dedication of a portion of vehicle license fee revenues. 
Counties receive 2011 Realignment funding from the following accounts and their related growth accounts: 
• Protective Services Subaccount (Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, and Adult Protective Services) 
• Behavioral Health Subaccount (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment; Mental Health Managed Care; 
Substance Abuse Treatment; and Women and Children's Residential Treatment) 
• Mental Health Account (Community Mental Health Programs) 
• Trial Court Security Subaccount 
• Enhancing Law Enforcement Activities Subaccount (Local Jurisdiction for Lower-level Offenders and Parole Violators and 
Adult Parole) 
• Community Corrections Subaccount 
• District Attorney and Public Defender Subaccount 
• Juvenile Justice Subaccount (consisting of the Youthful Offender Block Grant Special Account and Juvenile Reentry Grant 
Special Account) 
The funding reflected below and in the associated special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate" is an estimate based on 
statutory formulas and the most recent Department of Finance revenue figures. 
Note the $5 billion in 2018-19 and $5.2 billion in 2019-20 shown below reflect the Health and Human Services public safety 
programs. This display does not reflect the funding for the non-Health and Human Services public safety programs. For the full 
list of funding in 2011 Realignment, refer to the special display titled "2011 Realignment Estimate."
