Natural
Resources
Natural Resources Agency programs protect and
restore California's diverse natural and cultural
resources for current and future generations,
including operating state parks, managing water
supplies, supporting forest health, encouraging
clean energy, and preserving fish and wildlife
habitats, rich farmlands and mineral resources.
Agency programs also protect the public through
suppression of wildfires and construction of
levees in the Central Valley. These programs not
only contribute to the state's unique quality of
life, but also are critical to sustaining a vibrant
economy.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
2300 - EDUCATION 
 
Attracting over 2 million guests annually, the Science Center-Education represents one of California's premier educational
and family destinations.  Governed by a nine-member Board of Directors appointed by the Governor, the Science Center
develops and features award-winning exhibits and internationally renowned education programs. 
 
Hands-on educational exhibits and programs focus on science, math, technology, and conservation which explore biological
processes of humans, animals, plants, the Earth's ecosystems, habitats, and geophysical processes, as well as engineering,
communications, and transportation, on land and in space.  In 2012, the Space Shuttle Endeavour was moved to its
temporary home - the Samuel Oschin Pavilion - while design and construction of the Science Center's Air and Space Center
- its permanent home - is completed. 
 
In addition, the Science Center operates a 3D IMAX theater which features science related films and documentaries.  The
Center for Science Learning offers professional development programs to improve math and science skills of teachers and
other educators.  The Science Center School is a K-5 science, math and technology focused neighborhood charter school.
As a Title I school, it serves one of the more underserved and economically challenged communities in South Los Angeles.
The school's instructional programs and teacher training meet California science standards. 
 
The Science Center's mission values accessibility and inclusiveness and strives to inspire interest in science among those
traditionally underrepresented in science, math, technology and engineering.  The Science Center receives significant
funding support for exhibit development and capital outlay projects from the California Science Center Foundation.

OEPM is responsible for the negotiations of ground leases and agreements which impact the state's interest, including
development of park facilities and future infrastructure improvements.  Exposition Park enriches the internal park community
and in addition provides green space and recreational areas for the surrounding neighborhood. 
 
2310 - CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM

The California Tahoe Conservancy's mission is to lead California's efforts to restore and enhance the extraordinary natural
and recreational resources of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and
implementing programs that acquire environmentally sensitive land, provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention
and watershed restoration, improve stream environments and wildlife habitats, and improve water quality. The Conservancy
also balances these activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally
sound manner by acquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities. 
 
The Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) which is a 1997
agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments,
and various private entities to commit $908 million over 10 years to a list of acquisition and capital improvement projects
needed to achieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of
projects, modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. The 2008-2018 EIP was finalized in
July 2009. 
 
Because the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
2340 - TAHOE CONSERVANCY 
 
The California Tahoe Conservancy performs day-to-day management and maintenance of the lands it has acquired, as well
as the completion of corrective and restorative actions needed to fully achieve the purposes of the acquisitions. It is
envisioned that the Conservancy ultimately will acquire up to 6,000 environmentally sensitive parcels under existing criteria.
To date nearly 4,900 parcels, totaling nearly 6,500 acres, have been acquired. These parcels are being managed to
maintain and/or restore their natural functions, provide for public safety, and provide for open spaces. 
 
The Conservancy has also acquired additional parcels where more extensive site improvements or more active ultimate
uses are envisioned. For example, the management objectives for the public access and recreation lands are to allow for:
suitable and appropriate interim uses during the site improvement planning and implementation process, design and
construction of public access facilities, and long-term management. 
 
In addition, high rates of tree mortality (25 percent-40 percent) throughout the Basin have required special emphasis on
forest resource management activities to reduce fuel hazards, remove hazardous conditions, start corrective actions to
manage forest health through a variety of means, and limit public liability. Activities include the removal of diseased, dead
and dying trees to promote forest health while reducing the risk of fire that would destroy property and habitat, threaten lives,
and diminish the water quality and other resource values of Lake Tahoe. 
 
The program also provides grants to local governments to improve the Lake's water quality by controlling soil erosion caused
by existing development, primarily along roadways, and to treat sediment-laden runoff. These projects involve acquisitions
and site improvements such as the revegetation of barren slopes, and building roadside and storm drainage facilities and
sediment basins. 
 
2345 - ACQUISITION AND SITE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 
 
This program acquires environmentally sensitive lands and provides public access and recreation by enhancing existing
facilities and establishing new public access sites along the Lake and in natural areas. The program also preserves a wide
variety of habitats supporting endangered, threatened or rare animal and plant species, and restores streams and
watersheds such as marshes, meadows and riparian areas to mitigate development damage and enhance water quality.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Tahoe Conservancy (Conservancy) manages programs to help protect Lake Tahoe's water quality and conserve wildlife
habitat, watershed areas, and public access on the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin.  The Conservancy is a primary
implementer of the State of California's responsibilities under the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Lake
Tahoe Basin - a 1997 agreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal
government, local governments, and various private entities.  The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined
estimates of projects, modifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. The 2008-2018 EIP was
finalized in July 2009. Based on the 2008-2018 EIP, the Conservancy has identified its own EIP project list for new funding.

3340    California Conservation Corps
 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires,
floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation
measures at public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic
skills to become strong workers and citizens. 
 
In addition to the CCC, there are also 13 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state
that are annually certified by the California Conservation Corps, and engage young people in conservation, recycling,
education, and training activities. 
 
Because CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to support
this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 8 residential and 18 non-residential
facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities help the CCC achieve its mission of providing employment, training,
and educational opportunities to young men and women, and assisting federal, state and local agencies, and nonprofit
entities with the conservation of California's natural resources. 
 
The CCC residential facilities house 80-100 corpsmembers and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people together
from across the state, increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects.  Non-residential centers range
in size from 30-60 corpsmembers and allow young people with families to live at home and report to work.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
2420 - GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION 
 
This program evaluates, assesses and maps the state's geologic and seismologic hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides,
tsunami and volcanic eruption threats, and hazardous minerals exposures, in order to protect the public health and safety
and the natural environment; analyzes the state's mineral assets and maps its mineral resources. Information is used by
federal, state, and local government agencies, industries and individual businesses, and the public to make informed
decisions about land use, seismic safety, and mineral development. 
 
2425 - OIL, GAS, AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES 
 
This program regulates the drilling, operation, and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells to protect the
environment, prevent pollution, and ensure public safety. The state is fully reimbursed for program expenditures by annual
assessments and fees on the respective industries. Approximately 450 companies operate over 88,000 wells in California for
the production of oil, natural gas, and geothermal resources. 
 
2430 - LAND RESOURCE PROTECTION 
 
This program protects agricultural farmland and open space through various financial incentives. Under the Land
Conservation Act, landowners who agree to keep their property undeveloped for at least ten years receive lower property tax
assessments. The California Farmland Conservancy Program provides grants to local governments and nonprofit land trusts
for the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements that permanently remove development rights, and therefore
development pressure, from agricultural lands. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program within the Land Resource
Protection Program  develops maps, statistics, and reports relating to farmland conversion, farmland inventory, and land
protection to assist in local land use decisions. 
 
2435 - MINE RECLAMATION 
 
This program regulates active surface mining operations and monitors local lead agencies to ensure compliance with the
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. It assists cities, counties, state agencies, and mine operators in their efforts to
reclaim mined lands to beneficial uses. This program also compiles an inventory of the state's estimated 47,000 abandoned
mines and remediates abandoned mine hazards to protect public safety. 
 
2440 - STATE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD 
 
The Board serves as a regulatory and policy body for the state's geology, geologic and seismologic hazards, conservation of
mineral resources, and reclamation of mined lands. The Department's California Geological Survey and the Office of Mine
Reclamation provide the engineering, technical expertise, and support functions for the reports, plans, and maps which the
Board approves. The Board also serves as an appeals body for mining operations that have been issued notices of
violations or orders to comply, and disputes with local lead agencies.

CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS
 
3540    Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
 
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) serves and safeguards the people and protects the
property and resources of California. 
 
CAL FIRE provides all hazard emergency - fire, medical, rescue and disaster - response to the public and provides
leadership in the protection of life, property and natural resources. 
 
CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life
safety programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information & education; resource protection; and emergency
response. 
 
CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing
diverse yet complementary efforts including: training California's fire service professionals; public education and prevention
awareness; responsible stewardship of our natural resources; and natural resource and emergency management. 
 
CAL FIRE's highly trained professionals and leaders cultivate mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all
levels of government and the private sector to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and
mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wild land areas of California. 
 
CAL FIRE promotes a culture of innovation, accountability, integrity, diversity, planning, workplace safety, and teamwork to
foster an efficient and effective organizational environment. 
 
Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to
support this need. For the specifics on the department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Climate Adaptation Extended Fire Season - The Budget includes $42 million General Fund and $309,000 various special
funds and reimbursements to expand the state's firefighting capabilities and extend the fire season. Specifically, this
proposal: (1) adds 42 year-round engines, (2) staffs CAL FIRE engines and helitack bases one month earlier in spring,
and (3) extends peak staffing in fall by approximately two weeks.  These additional resources will also allow CAL FIRE to
complete a greater number of fuel reduction projects during the off-peak season, helping to reduce the fire risk from
climate change, drought and tree mortality. 
 
Drought Legacy and Tree Mortality Response - The Budget includes $38.7 million General Fund and $3 million State
Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund for expanded fire protection in the 2017 fire season in recognition of continuing
tree mortality.  These funds will support the continuation of firefighter surge capacity, California Conservation Corps fire
crews, and exclusive use of one large air tanker.  In addition, $10 million State Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund is
available for grants to support local fire prevention activities.

2460 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal is moving to Program 2461. See description below.  
 
2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal is responsible for the statewide protection of life and property through the development
and application of fire protection engineering, education and enforcement. 
 
2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) includes the following activities: 
Code Development and Analysis: Objectives include the development and adoption of codes relating to fire/life safety
used statewide by local fire and building authorities. The Code Development and Analysis Division fosters, promotes and
develops ways and means of protecting life and property against fire in many ways, including the adoption and
implementation of regulations for statewide application. This division prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations
and building standards for review and adoption into the California Code of Regulations, Titles 19 and 24. The division
assists with the application of state laws, regulations, and code enforcement relating by a city, county, fire departments or

officers and receives program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services.
 
2461019 - California Underground Facilities Safe Excavation Board: 
The Board, created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661), works on issues related to the State's "Call
Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators, except in the case of an emergency, to contact a regional notification
center, as specified. 
 
2465 - FIRE PROTECTION 
 
CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property and natural resources within social, political and
economic constraints. The objective is to quickly and aggressively attack all fires in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed
primary direct protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial
attack and follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires
within the first burning period. 
 
2465010 - Fire Prevention: 
This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression
cost recovery and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials and procedures
to mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs
to be done before a wildland fire starts in order to reduce the costs of fire fighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire
fighters and damage to the environment. 
 
2465019 - Fire Control: 
The objective of this program is to detect, respond and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility
Area. The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to
10 acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews,
bulldozers, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. 
 
2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection: 
CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state and federal agencies throughout California
through the administration of over 100 cooperative government agreements.  Additionally, there are six long standing
agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department. 
 
2465037 - Conservation Camps: 
CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Operations and Juvenile
Justice, operates 39 conservation camps throughout the state that house 196 fire crews. These crews provide one of the
primary labor forces for firefighting, emergency response, and conservation related work projects. 
 
2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 
CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope
with a wildland fire within the initial attack period.  Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense
was incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or through cost shares provided by other government entities.  In addition, CAL FIRE may
recover portions of this cost through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes. 
 
2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
 
California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands and urban forests provide multiple human, climate and
environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to
these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting,
coordination of climate related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial landowners, operation of
state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects and administration of federal
forestry assistance programs. 
 
2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement: 
The objective of this program is to improve forest lands and urban forests.  Activities include the detection, evaluation and
control of forest pests; growing and selling tree seedlings for reforestation, carbon sequestration, and soil erosion control;
maintenance of a native conifer seed bank; advice and assistance to non-industrial forest landowners on management of
forests and improved harvesting and conservation practices; research on and demonstration of sustainable forestry in state
forests; implementation of the California Forest Improvement Act of 1978; technical assistance and grants to foster the
environmental, social, and economic benefits of urban forests consistent with the California Urban Forestry Act of 1978; and
purchase and monitoring of working forest conservation easements per the California Forest Legacy Act of 2008.  In the

3560    State Lands Commission
 
The California State Lands Commission serves the people of California by providing stewardship of the lands, waterways,
and resources entrusted to its care through preservation, restoration, enhancement, responsible economic development,
and the promotion of public access. Diligent execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has
resulted in the generation of over $11 billion in revenues while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy those
lands and resources. 
 
Consisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State
Lands Commission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing California's sovereign public trust lands and
resources, which the state received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands subsequently
conveyed to the state by the federal government (commonly known as "school" lands) and oversees the management of
public trust lands legislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage development and use of
the state's tidelands consistent with the public trust doctrine, and typically require grantees to reinvest revenues produced
from the granted lands back into the trust. 
 
Public trust or "sovereign" lands include the beds of all natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams
and lakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays and the Pacific Ocean extending from the mean
high tide line seaward to the three-mile offshore limit and totaling over four and one-half million acres. In addition to
sovereign lands, the Commission manages "school" lands, which were granted to California by the federal government
under the Act of March 3, 1853 (10 Stat. 244) for the purpose of supporting public education in California. School lands
include the 16th and 36th sections of each township (with the exception of lands already reserved for public use or
previously taken by private claims) and lands known to be mineral in character. Of the five and one-half million acres of
school lands originally granted to the state, only about 460,370 acres remain in state ownership and these are mostly
concentrated in the California desert. The Commission also retains a reserved mineral interest in approximately 790,000
acres of sold school lands.

2560 - MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT 
 
The State Lands Commission oversees efficient and safe development of mineral resources that are located on state lands.
The State also has a beneficial interest in the Long Beach tidelands oils fields, and as such, the Commission participates in
the safety and fiscal oversight of these fields. The program objectives are to: manage the responsible extraction of oil, gas,
geothermal resources and other minerals; collect revenues generated consistent with the best interests of the state, and
ensure that public safety and environmental protection are maintained at the highest possible standards in the development
of these resources through engineering review, marine facility inspections, and safety audits. The Commission also adopts
regulations for the prevention of oil spills, the safe operation of offshore facilities and program and financial audits to ensure
the state receives fair value for the development of its resources. 
 
2565 - LAND MANAGEMENT 
 
The State Lands Commission manages all ungranted state sovereign lands consistent with the common law public trust
doctrine and prudent land use and management practices. The Commission issues leases and permits for the use and
occupation of public trust lands under its jurisdiction based upon environmental, economic, health, safety and public benefit
considerations. The program also manages all state school lands to ensure the greatest economic return to the State
Teachers' Retirement System. The Commission also oversees the administration of public trust lands legislatively granted to
local jurisdictions to manage on behalf of the State, including the major ports in the State.

3560    State Lands Commission - Continued
The State Lands Commission adopts rules, regulations, and guidelines for marine oil terminals within California, providing
the best achievable protection of the public health and safety and the environment. The Commission's Marine Environmental
Protection Program monitors the transfer of oil at marine terminals, inspects all marine facilities and reviews, and approves
all marine oil terminal operations manuals and training and certification programs . The Program also administers Chapter
31F of the California Building Code to ensure that marine oil terminals are fit for purpose. In addition, the Marine
Environmental Protection Program implements the state's Marine Invasive Species Program to prevent the introduction of
non-indigenous species into California waters through vessel mediated vectors. The program funds and conducts scientific
research, develops rules and regulations to implement the Marine Invasive Species Act, and physically inspects oceangoing
vessels to assess compliance with vessel-reported nonindigenous species management actions.

3600    Department of Fish and Wildlife
 
The mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and
the habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public. 
 
This includes habitat protection and maintenance in a sufficient amount and quality to ensure the survival of all species and
natural communities. The Department is also responsible for the diversified use of fish and wildlife including recreational,
commercial, scientific, and educational uses. 
 
Because the Department of Fish and Wildlife programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a
capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure
Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
 
Pursuing Collaborative Solutions to Water Supply Reliability and Watershed Health - $1.1 million General Fund and five
positions for the Department of Fish and Wildlife to provide legal, scientific, and other expertise. Voluntary efforts are
needed to integrate watershed restoration projects with updated river flow regimes to help salmon and other fisheries
thrive. Agreements would describe additional water flows and habitat restoration and other measures in the major rivers
that flow to the Delta.
 
Concluding Drought Response - $2.6 million ongoing General Fund to sustain resilient systems for protection of fish
and wildlife affected by future drought and climate change. During the recent drought, significant investments have
been made to ensure that the state is better prepared to mitigate the harmful effects of future droughts on fish and
wildlife resources. These resiliency measures include installation of filtration equipment at fish hatcheries, improved
water use efficiency at wildlife areas, and a network of fish and wildlife monitoring systems throughout the state.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
2590 - BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROGRAM 
 
This program encourages the preservation, conservation, maintenance, and restoration of wildlife resources, including the
Ecosystem Restoration Program, under the jurisdiction and influence of the state. Activities involve the conservation,
protection and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat to ensure maintenance of biologically sustainable
populations of those species. 
 
2595 - HUNTING, FISHING, AND PUBLIC USE PROGRAM 
 
This program facilitates diverse and sustainable hunting, fishing (recreational and commercial), trapping, and other public
uses and associated economic benefits to the state by conserving and managing game species. Activities include collection
and assessment of information on the distribution and abundance of game fish and wildlife to determine appropriate
regulations (bag limits, gear restrictions, etc.) and to monitor the effects of those regulations. 
 
2600 - MANAGEMENT OF DEPARTMENT LANDS AND FACILITIES PROGRAM 
 
This program manages Department-owned or leased lands and facilities, including hatcheries, wildlife areas, ecological
reserves, fish and wildlife laboratories, and public access areas, to contribute to the conservation, protection, and
management of fish and wildlife. 
 
2605 - ENFORCEMENT 
 
This program serves the public through law enforcement, public safety and hunter education.  Law enforcement promotes
compliance with laws and regulations protecting fish and wildlife resources; investigates habitat destruction, pollution
incidents and illegal commercialization of wildlife.  Wardens also serve the public through general law enforcement, mutual
aid and homeland security. 
 
2610 - COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH PROGRAM 
 
This program serves the public through resource conservation education and use activities in the classroom and on public
and private lands, community and stakeholder outreach, and the delivery of information and data using a variety of methods
including publications, presentations, web applications and media relations. 
 
2615 - SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM 
 
This program prevents damage, minimizes environmental impacts, restores, and rehabilitates California's fish and wildlife
populations and their habitats from the harmful effects of oil and other deleterious material spills in marine waters and inland
habitats. 
 
2620 - FISH AND GAME COMMISSION 
 
The California Fish and Game Commission ensures the long term sustainability of California's fish and wildlife resources by
guiding the ongoing scientific evaluation and assessment of California's fish and wildlife resources; setting California's fish
and wildlife resource management policies and ensuring these are implemented by the Department of Fish and Wildlife;
establishing appropriate fish and wildlife resource management rules and regulations; and building active fish and wildlife
resource management partnerships with individual landowners, the public and interest groups, and federal, state and local
resource management agencies.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Department of Fish and Wildlife manages 742 properties statewide, comprising more than 1 million acres
(approximately 679,000 acres owned by the state and 484,000 acres owned by other entities, but managed by the
Department. Several state agencies purchase land for the purpose of habitat or wildlife protection, and management
responsibilities for these properties are often transferred to the Department; therefore, the amount of land under Department
control continues to increase. The properties managed by the Department include: 111 wildlife areas, 136 ecological
reserves, 138 public access areas, and 20 fish hatcheries.

3720    California Coastal Commission
 
The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed equally by the Governor, the Senate Rules
Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the
California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and
recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic
resources, and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. New development in the coastal
zone requires a coastal permit either from local government or the Commission. Local governments are required to prepare
a local coastal program (LCP) for the coastal zone portion of their jurisdiction. After an LCP has been reviewed and
approved by the Commission as being consistent with the Coastal Act, the Commission's regulatory authority over most
types of new development is delegated to the local government, subject to limited appeals to the Commission. The
Commission also is designated the principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal
Coastal Zone Management Act in California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits,
leases, federal development projects, and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not

Reviewing and approval of local coastal programs (LCPs), port master plans, university long-range development plans,
and any amendments to such plans, for consistency with the Coastal Act.
Reviewing coastal development permit applications for new development in areas without a certified LCP, areas of
permanently retained jurisdiction (e.g., tidelands, submerged lands, and public trust lands) and limited categories of local
coastal development permit actions that can be appealed to the Commission.
Monitoring and enforcement of coastal development permits.
Reviewing federal activities for consistency with the Coastal Act.
Protecting and expanding opportunities for public coastal access and recreation.
Implementing a coastal water quality protection program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
2790 - COASTAL CONSERVANCY PROGRAM 
 
The Coastal Conservancy seeks to achieve the following goals: 
Protect and enhance habitats, wetlands, scenic open space, working lands and urban waterfronts along the California
coast and around San Francisco Bay. 
Increase public access to the coast and outdoor recreational opportunities by creating new parks, trails and recreational
amenities. 
Prepare for and reduce the unavoidable impacts of climate change on the coastal region and San Francisco Bay Area.
Support education programs about coastal resources for kindergarten through grade 12. 
 
2805 - STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
 
The State Coastal Conservancy provides grants and technical assistance to local governments, nonprofits and other project
partners for the acquisition of land and easements, the development of public facilities, and the restoration of habitat. The
State Coastal Conservancy helps to implement the State's federally approved Coastal Management Program. The
Conservancy has participated in the protection of more than 390,000 acres of coastal lands through acquisition of fee title
and conservation easements. The Conservancy has helped restore more than 33,000 acres of habitat. 
 
Through its projects, the Conservancy has established approximately 160 new coastal accessways and built more than 168
miles of new trails. 
 
State Coastal Conservancy funds are primarily expended for purposes of local assistance but may also be expended for

easements, the development of public facilities, and the restoration of habitat. The State Coastal Conservancy helps to
implement the State's federally approved Coastal Management Program. The Conservancy has participated in the protection
of more than 390,000 acres of coastal lands through acquisition of fee title and conservation easements. The Conservancy

3790    Department of Parks and Recreation
 
The mission of the California Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) is to provide for the health, inspiration, and
education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state's extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most
valued natural, cultural and historical resources, and creating opportunities for high-quality outdoor recreation for current and
future generations to enjoy. With increased urbanization, the establishment of park units and recreation areas accessible to
the major population centers of the state has become particularly important. Specific activities include: stewardship of natural
resources, historic, cultural and archeological sites, and artifacts and structures; provision of interpretive services for park
visitors; construction and maintenance of campsites, trails, visitor centers, museums, and infrastructure such as roads and
water systems; and creation of recreational opportunities such as hiking, bicycling, fishing, swimming, horseback riding,
jogging, camping, picnicking, and off-highway vehicle recreation. In addition, the Division of Boating and Waterways funds,
plans, and develops boating facilities on waterways throughout California and ensures safe boating for the public by
providing financial aid and training to local law enforcement agencies.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The system consists of 280 parks, beaches, trails, wildlife areas, open spaces, off-highway vehicle areas, and historic sites.
Parks is responsible for approximately 1.6 million acres of land, including over 343 miles of coastline, 984 miles of lake,
reservoir and river frontage, approximately 15,000 campsites and alternative camping facilities, and 5,124 miles of non-
motorized trails. 
 
Over the past five years, Parks has expended approximately $130 million to develop and expand the state park system.
Parks has accepted gifts and other donations of property and historic structures at no cost to the state when those donations
made programmatic sense.

3820    San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission
 
The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is a state planning and regulatory agency with regional
authority. Its mission is to protect and enhance San Francisco Bay and to encourage the Bay's responsible and productive
use for this and future generations. The Commission authored and maintains the San Francisco Bay Plan and relies on it,
the McAteer-Petris Act, and other regulatory authority to maximize public access to the Bay and minimize Bay fill. The
Commission issues permits for filling, dredging, and development projects within the Bay, along the Bay shoreline, and
within salt ponds and certain managed wetlands adjacent to the Bay. The Commission also implements the Suisun Marsh
Preservation Act of 1977. By state statute, the Commission develops and implements the federal Coastal Zone Management
Act's program for the Bay and exercises authority over federal activities otherwise not subject to state control. The
Commission leads the ongoing multi-agency regional effort to address the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on
the Bay and its environs. Funding for these efforts to address climate change is derived mainly from federal grants and other
agreements, contracts, and reimbursements.

implementing five major programs: Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Preserve Natural/Cultural Resources,
Water Quality and Natural Flood Conveyance, and Organizational Capacity and Reach. This mission will be accomplished in
part by building, with our partners, a San Diego River Park and hiking trail stretching from the headwaters in Julian to the

3860    Department of Water Resources
 
The Department of Water Resources protects, conserves, develops, and manages California's water. The Department
evaluates existing water resources, forecasts future water needs and explores future potential solutions to meet ever-
growing needs for personal use, irrigation, industry, recreation, power generation, and fish and wildlife. The Department also
works to prevent and minimize flood damage, oversee the safety of dams, and educate the public about the importance of
water and its efficient use. 
 
Because the Department's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital outlay program
to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
3230 - CONTINUING FORMULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER PLAN 
 
The California Water Plan is the state's strategic plan for the efficient use, management and development of the state's
water resources. The Plan is updated every five years and provides a framework for water managers, legislators, and the
public to consider options and make decisions regarding California's water future. The Plan evaluates current and future
water conditions, challenges and opportunities. It presents basic data and information on California's water resources
including water supply evaluations and assessments of existing and future agricultural, urban, and environmental water
uses. The Plan identifies and evaluates multiple future scenarios and over 30 resource management strategies such as
conservation, recycling, desalination, transfers, storage, conveyance, water quality, watershed management, ecosystem
restoration, and urban land use management to help meet future demands in light of uncertainties and unexpected
catastrophic events. This program also identifies ways for the state to: (1) help local agencies and governments prepare
integrated regional water management plans on a watershed basis and diversify their regional water portfolios to ensure
sustainable water uses, reliable water supplies, better water quality, environmental stewardship, efficient urban
development, protection of agriculture, and a strong economy, (2) help cities, counties and local agencies prepare a Water
Element for their General Plans, Urban Water Management Plans and Agricultural Water Management Plans, and (3) help
local agencies and tribal governments improve coordination between water and land use planning. 
 
3240 - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM 
 
The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage facilities (reservoirs and lakes),
20 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700 miles of conveyance (canals,
pipelines, and tunnels). The Project provides water to over 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated farmland. 
 
The Department plans, designs, constructs, operates, maintains, and manages State Water Project facilities which provide
water to facilities located from Plumas County to Riverside County. 
 
The Delta Habitat Conservation and Conveyance Program is charged with improving the Delta ecosystem and ensuring
water supply reliability in a safe, timely, and cost effective manner. This includes development of the Bay Delta Conservation
Plan, project specific conservation measures, and the Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement. 
 
3245 - PUBLIC SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF DAMAGE 
 
This program supports the California Water Action Plan by protecting life and property from damage by floods, ensures
proper construction and maintenance of jurisdictional dams and levees, and provides loans for the construction. Activities
include assessing the state and regional investment needs to reduce risk, preventive floodplain management to discourage
unwise use of areas subject to flooding, protection of floodplains, issuance of flood warnings, operation of flood control
facilities, coordination and supervision of flood fight activities, and annual levee and flood channel maintenance and
inspection in cooperation with other local, state, and federal partner agencies. This program also buys land, easements, and
rights-of-way for federal flood control projects and supervises the design and construction of new dams and periodic
inspection and reevaluation of all existing jurisdictional dams for proper operation and maintenance. Fiscal oversight and
coordination activities associated with the Disaster Preparedness and Flood Prevention Bond Act of 2006 are administered
under this program. The program also reviews federal dam projects in coordination with federal and other state agencies
with regard to dam safety. 
 
3250 - CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD 
 
The Central Valley Flood Protection Board has regulatory authority over the State Plan of Flood Control facilities (SPFC),
designated floodways and regulated streams in the Central Valley.  The Board regulates encroachments on the system by
issuing permits and initiating enforcement action when necessary to maintain the integrity of the levees and floodways that
protect the valley's people and property.  The Board manages the state's portfolio of real property held by the Sacramento-
San Joaquin Drainage District.  The Board serves as the non-federal sponsor to the United States Army Corps of Engineers
on large joint state-federal levee improvement projects and assists the more than one hundred local maintaining agencies
that operate and maintain the SPFC.  The Board conducts regular public meetings, workshops and tours, providing a public
forum for stakeholders.

This program provides technical support within the Department and expertise in the fields of water resources planning,
development and management; watermaster services; scientific analyses performed by DWR's chemical laboratory;
information technology; and mapping, surveying and engineering services for other agencies. 
 
3260 - CALIFORNIA ENERGY RESOURCES SCHEDULING 
 
For a limited period of time, this program purchased electric power on behalf of the state's investor-owned utilities. Beginning
January 1, 2003, the utility companies resumed responsibility for purchasing power from the spot market. The utilities,
however, continued to receive power from the Department's long-term energy contracts with energy suppliers, under which
the Department retains legal and financial responsibility.  All energy contracts signed by the Department have now expired
or were terminated.  However, litigation continues against some of the counterparties to these contracts. Additionally, the
Department retains the legal and financial responsibility for administering $4.621 billion in revenue bonds issued to repay the
General Fund for money borrowed for power purchases during the energy crisis and funding of reserve accounts necessary
to maintain an investment grade credit rating associated with the revenue bonds.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Department of Water Resources has two major infrastructure programs: the State Water Project and the flood control
system in the Central Valley. The State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system that consists of 34 storage
facilities, reservoirs, and lakes, 20 pumping plants, 4 pumping-generating plants, 5 hydroelectric power plants, and over 700
miles of canals, pipelines, and tunnels. The Project provides water to 25 million Californians and 750,000 acres of irrigated
farmland. The Project also provides recreational opportunities to approximately 6 million visitors annually at 15 separate
reservoir-based facilities as well as public fishing access to much of the Aqueduct. Existing flood control infrastructure in the
Central Valley consists of 1,595 miles of levees, 348,000 acres of channels and floodways, over 800,000 linear feet of bank
protection, over 60 mitigation and environmental restoration sites, and 55 various flood control structures including dams,
weirs, pumping plants, diversion structures, gate structures, and drop structures. In general, these facilities provide more
flood protection in urbanized areas and less in agricultural areas.

3885    Delta Stewardship Council
 
Established in 2009 by the Delta Reform Act, the mission of the Delta Stewardship Council, through a seven-member board,
is to further the state's coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and
enhancing the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem.  The coequal goals are to be achieved in a manner that protects
and enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta.  In 2013, the Council
adopted a legally enforceable Delta Plan to further the coequal goals and guide state and local agency activities related to
the Delta.  Under state law, agencies are required to coordinate their actions pursuant to the Delta Plan with the Council and
the other relevant agencies.  The Council is informed by scientific input from the Delta Science Program and the Delta
Independent Science Board.  The mission of the Delta Science Program is to provide the best possible unbiased scientific
information to inform water and environmental decisionmaking in the Delta.
