The Department of Consumer Affairs (Department) is responsible for promoting and protecting the interests of millions of 
California consumers by serving as a guardian and advocate for their health, safety, and economic well-being and by promoting 
legal and ethical standards of professional conduct. The Department helps to promote good business practices and to ensure

In addition, centralized services are provided by the Department for efficiency. Specifically, Department staff investigate 
complaints against licensees; develop valid examinations for applicants for licensure; monitor and advocate for legislation; 
provide consumer education and outreach; provide legal and audit services; and provide general administrative support 
involving personnel, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, and space management. 
There are currently 26 boards, one committee, and one commission under the broad authority of the Department, and eight

1415 - BUREAU OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS AND SERVICES 
The Bureau of Household Goods and Services registers and regulates all businesses engaged in major home appliance and 
electronic equipment repair by imposing specific obligations of ethical conduct, honesty, and full and fair disclosure, providing 
certain safeguards to consumers when they need repair services or enter into service contract transactions, and ridding the 
repair industry of unscrupulous repair dealers and service contractors. The Bureau also regulates the manufacture, distribution, 
and sale of upholstered furniture, bedding, and thermal insulation products sold in California to ensure they meet health, safety, 
and flammability standards. Additionally, the Bureau regulates the licensee population of household movers and brokers of 
household movers that may be organized as a sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, or limited liability corporation. 
1420 - BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR 
The Bureau of Automotive Repair is responsible for regulating the automotive repair marketplace and administering the Smog 
Check Program. To carry out its mandate, the Bureau educates consumers, disciplines stations and technicians, seeks 
resolution to complaints, and licenses individuals and businesses. The Bureau also administers the nation's largest motor 
vehicle emissions reduction program. To help in its clean air efforts, the Bureau also administers the Consumer Assistance 
Program (CAP). Through CAP, consumers who own a vehicle that fails a biennial inspection and who meet certain eligibility 
requirements can receive financial assistance for emissions-related repairs. Further, consumers can receive a financial 
incentive to retire their unwanted vehicle at any time for any reason. The Bureau, in cooperation with the California Air 
Resources Board, also administers a voucher program that offers eligible consumers additional compensation toward the 
purchase of lower-emitting vehicles or transportation passes after they retire their vehicle through CAP.

legal assistance, review of legislation, examination validation and assistance, information technology, accounting, budgets, 
personnel, and other administrative functions. 
The Division also serves as the primary press office for the Department and is the primary developer of consumer alerts, fact 
sheets, and internet postings designed to raise awareness of consumer issues among consumers, the news media, and other 
stakeholders. Through its toll-free number, the Division operates a call center that assists consumers and licensees by 
distributing publications and applications for licensure and providing referrals to other consumer resources; responds to written 
correspondence; informs consumers about marketplace trends; and represents consumer interests at local, state, and federal 
levels.

establishing educational and experience requirements, conducting examinations, investigating violations of professional ethics 
and law, and disciplining licensees when appropriate.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission was established in 1975 to provide a coordinated framework for establishing 
consistent earthquake policies, advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public, and tracking the 
state’s progress toward higher levels of seismic safety. To support this broad mission, the Commission uses the expertise of its 
commissioners to review, evaluate, and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence 
earthquake safety policies. 
The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that 
support the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. These activities include: (1) developing and 
reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing a consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related 
legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies, 
where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and 
supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery. 
The Budget reflects the transfer of the Commission to the Office of Emergency Services beginning in 2020-21.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Transfer the Commission to the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES)—The Budget includes $2.5 million ($503,000 
General Fund) to transfer the Seismic Safety Commission to Cal OES. These resources will be critical to supporting the 
effective integration of the Seismic Safety Commission into Cal OES, resulting in increased coordination with other 
components of the state’s multi-hazard strategy, earthquake preparedness, and broader distribution of seismic safety 
policies and recommendations.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• California Consumer Financial Protection – The Budget includes $10.2 million growing to $19.3 million in 2022-23, in a set-
aside item to provide consumers—especially financially vulnerable populations—with more protection against unfair, 
deceptive, and abusive practices when accessing financial services and products.  The expenditure of these funds is 
contingent upon enactment of statutory changes that authorize the California Consumer Financial Protection Law program. 
The Administration and Legislature will work together over the summer to finalize the statutory framework needed to 
implement the program and other changes that aim to improve consumer protection for all Californians. This proposal 
includes: 1) creating a new Division of Consumer Financial Protection, and a related California Consumer Financial 
Protection Law, to expand oversight over current and emerging abusive acts and practices that cause consumers financial 
harm, and promote consumer-focused research and outreach; and 2) establishes an Office of Financial Technology 
Innovation to study emerging technologies in financial services, including virtual currencies, and to engage with California 
companies developing new financial products and services.

LEGAL CITATIONS AND AUTHORITY 
DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY 
Government Code section 65580 et seq.; Health and Safety Code sections 18000 et seq. and 50000 et seq. 
MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Federal Community Development Block Grant Program—The Budget includes $1.1 billion in federal disaster assistance 
funds to assist the state in its mitigation and disaster preparedness efforts in light of housing instability of victims of recent 
natural disasters. 
• Strategic Investments and Maximizing Federal Funds—Due to the fiscal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Budget 
makes strategic reductions designed to have minimal impact on state housing production efforts while maximizing the use of 
potential federal funds if they become available. The Budget reverts $203 million for HCD's Infill Infrastructure Grant 
Program of 2019 and $45 million for CalHFA's Mixed Income Program in 2020-21 that was appropriated in the 2019 Budget 
Act. While federal funds may restore these reductions, these programs will have other sources of funding to continue 
operations. 
• Transit-Oriented Development Program Alignment—The Budget aligns the schedule for the Transit-Oriented Development 
Program to issue more awards for housing production near major transit areas. HCD can award up to $141 million in 
available Proposition 1 funds in 2020-21. Additionally, HCD can award $19.9 million in available Proposition 1c funds for the 
Transit-Oriented Development Program. 
• Homekey—The Budget includes $600 million ($50 million General Fund and $550 million to be transferred from the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund) to support the acquisition, conversion, and rehabilitation of hotels, motels, and other properties to 
provide housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
1660 - CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM 
The objective of this program is to protect the public's health, safety, and general welfare in buildings and structures designed 
for human occupancy through the enforcement of the California Health and Safety Code, including the State Housing Law, 
Employee Housing Act, Mobilehome Parks Act, Special Occupancy Parks Act, California Factory-Built Housing Law, and the 
Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act of 1980. HCD works with factory and site-built building industries, stakeholders, and 
other government agencies to review and amend the international building codes used as the basis for all residential 
construction in California in order to develop the California Building Standards Code. The program also enforces federal and 
state standards for the construction, safety, sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars. 
1665 - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) increase housing supply by providing loans and grants to develop and preserve safe 
and affordable housing for lower-income households, (2) promote economic, community, and job development by awarding 
state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and (4) monitor 
funding recipients for compliance with the terms of their contracts with the state. 
1670 - HOUSING POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) facilitate an adequate supply of housing affordable to all income groups through the 
development, promotion, and implementation of innovative housing and community development policies, practices, programs, 
and partnerships with state, regional, and local partners, (2) provide oversight for local housing plans, (3) administer planning 
and incentive grant programs, and (4) provide research, collect and analyze data, and evaluate and communicate progress in 
meeting HCD goals and outcomes. 
1675 - CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY 
 
CalHFA is financially self-supporting, setting loan interest rates slightly above its cost and charging fees to cover its lending 
costs and risks. The objective of CalHFA's lending activity is to finance housing at affordable interest rates using lending 
models that facilitate: (1) mortgage loans to qualified low and moderate income homebuyers to finance the purchase of an 
affordable home, (2) permanent loans to create and preserve multifamily housing projects for low and moderate income 
residents, and (3) special needs housing loans to facilitate the construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing needed to 
serve special needs populations.
