2240   Department of Housing and Community Development 
The Department of Housing and Community Development's (HCD's) mission is to preserve and expand safe and affordable 
housing opportunities and promote strong communities for all Californians by (1) administering housing finance, economic 
development, and community development programs, (2) developing housing policy and advocating for an adequate housing 
supply, and (3) developing building codes and regulating manufactured homes and mobilehome parks. HCD also provides 
technical and financial assistance to local agencies to support community development. 
The California Housing Finance Agency's (CalHFA's) mission is to create and finance progressive housing solutions so more 
Californians have a place to call home. The Agency's Multifamily Division finances affordable rental housing through public and 
private partnerships, while its Single Family Division provides first mortgage loans and down payment assistance to first-time 
homebuyers. CalHFA, a statutorily independent agency and component unit of state government, is not subject to Budget Act 
appropriation. Effective July 1, 2013, pursuant to the Governor's Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 2012, CalHFA is displayed, for 
budgetary purposes only, within HCD's budget, and reports to the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Local Government Planning Support Grants Program- The Budget allocates $250 million in planning grants to support local 
governments and regions in meeting ambitious housing goals for the next regional housing needs allocation. 
• Infill Infrastructure Grant Program- The Budget allocates $500 million in competitive and over-the-counter grants for qualified 
capital improvement projects (i.e. streets, parking lots, utilities) integral to developing qualifying infill areas or projects. This 
will help remove a barrier to building and spur production in high density areas. Under this program, local governments and 
developers can partner to apply for infrastructure grants. 
• Moderate-Income Housing Production - The Budget allocates $500 million to CalHFA to develop new low- and moderate-
income housing. This loan program will expand on the Mixed Income Loan Program funded through ongoing SB 2 revenues 
and pair with tax credits targeting households with incomes between 30 and 120 percent Area Median Income.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
1660 - CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM 
The objective of this program is to protect the public's health, safety, and general welfare in buildings and structures designed 
for human occupancy through the enforcement of the California Health and Safety Code, including the State Housing Law, 
Employee Housing Act, Mobilehome Parks Act, Special Occupancy Parks Act, California Factory-Built Housing Law, and the 
Mobilehome-Manufactured Housing Act of 1980. HCD works with factory and site-built building industries, stakeholders, and 
other government agencies to review and amend the international building codes as the basis for residential construction in 
order to develop the California Building Standards Code. The program also enforces federal and state standards for the 
construction, safety, sales, and titling of manufactured homes, mobilehomes, and commercial modulars. 
1665 - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) increase housing supply by providing loans and grants to develop and preserve safe 
and affordable housing for lower-income households, (2) promote economic, community, and job development by awarding 
state and federal housing funds, (3) reduce homelessness through financial assistance and policy leadership, and (4) monitor 
funding recipients for compliance with the terms of their contracts with the state. 
1670 - HOUSING POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
The objectives of this program are to: (1) facilitate an adequate supply of housing affordable to all income groups through the 
development, promotion, and implementation of innovative housing and community development policies, practices, programs,

meeting HCD goals and outcomes. 
1675 - CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY 
 
CalHFA is financially self-supporting, setting loan interest rates slightly above its cost and charging fees to cover its lending 
costs and risks. The objective of CalHFA's lending activity is to finance housing at affordable interest rates using lending 
models that facilitate: (1) mortgage loans to qualified low and moderate income homebuyers to finance the purchase of an 
affordable home, (2) permanent loans to create and preserve multifamily housing projects for low and moderate income 
residents, and (3) special needs housing loans to facilitate the construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition of housing needed to 
serve special needs populations. 
1680 - LOAN REPAYMENTS PROGRAM 
This program displays the estimated loan repayments made under HCD's Financial Assistance Program. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM 
This program provides: (1) executive leadership in designing, implementing, and communicating housing programs and 
policies, (2) fiduciary oversight and fiscal management through its audit, accounting, and budget functions, (3) development, 
review, and implementation of legislation related to HCD programs, (4) housing-specific legal expertise, and (5) support 
services in the areas of personnel, information technology, business services, and contract management.
