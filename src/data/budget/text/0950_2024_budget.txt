such as those associated with the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the state's 
retirement system, etc. The Division also administers the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), a voluntary investment 
program created to offer California local agencies greater access to the financial markets through the PMIB program. In the 
2022-23 fiscal year, 2,361 local agencies participated in LAIF, with deposits averaging $28.7 billion for the fiscal year. 
0740019 - CENTRALIZED TREASURY AND SECURITIES MANAGEMENT 
In 1949, the California Legislature amended Government Code Section 16305 to create the Centralized Treasury System 
(CTS) thereby requiring agencies of the State to deposit their money in trust with the Treasurer. The legislation also requires 
the Treasurer to safeguard the money and make safe and prudent investments. In 1955, the Legislature created the PMIB, 
giving the PMIB the responsibility to designate the amount of money available for the investment in securities, bank deposits, 
and loans to the General Fund. 
The Centralized Treasury and Securities Management Division (CTSMD) oversees all banking aspects of the CTS. The goal of 
the CTSMD is to maximize the earning of interest consistent with safe and prudent treasury management, and to ensure that 
the depository banks provide the state with proper and adequate security for the deposit of state monies. The Treasurer 
maintains demand bank accounts with seven banks for the purpose of providing necessary statewide depository coverage for 
the remittance of funds collected by the various state agencies. 
The CTSMD 1) monitors the cash flow of all state funds, forecasts cash balances, revenue, expenditures, and the amounts 
available for daily investments, 2) ensures accurate and timely agency deposits, 3) administers and executes the wire transfer 
of funds, 4) reconciles state accounts with depository banks, 5) redeems all state items submitted by presenting banks for 
payment, 6) executes the clearance and income collection for state investments (excluding PERS and STRS) and securities 
pledged to the state, 7) fulfills the clearance and settlement of securities pledged to the state as collateral for the time, demand, 
and other state agency programs, and 8) is responsible for the safekeeping of securities and other personal property owned by 
or pledged to the state. 
0740028 - PUBLIC FINANCE 
The Public Finance Division is responsible for selling State of California general obligation bonds, commercial paper notes, 
revenue anticipation notes, lease revenue bonds, revenue bonds, and any other indebtedness for all state agencies. The 
Division provides debt administration services for most state bonds and is responsible for disseminating information to 
bondholders through the Investor Relations Program. 
The Division also assures compliance with federal tax laws applicable to certain state debt so there is no adverse 
consequences to bondholders or increased borrowing costs to the state. The post-issuance tax compliance includes monitoring 
the use of bond proceeds, managing rebate and yield restriction compliance, coordinating necessary financial disclosure, and 
ensuring proper record keeping. 
0740035 - ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
The Administration Division, Executive Office, and the Information Services Division provide executive direction and support 
services to programs in the State Treasurer's Office. Services include budgeting, personnel, accounting, information systems, 
business services, technical support, and production operations.
