3540   Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 
The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) provides all hazard—fire, medical, rescue, and 
disaster—emergency response to the public and provides leadership in the protection of life, property, and natural resources in 
California. 
CAL FIRE safeguards the public through: engineering; research, development and adoption of regulations; fire and life safety 
programs; fire prevention, law enforcement, and public information and education; resource protection; and emergency 
response. 
CAL FIRE limits the damage caused by fires, disasters, environmental degradation, and related emergencies by employing 
diverse yet complementary efforts, including: training California's fire service professionals, public education and prevention 
awareness, responsible stewardship of our natural resources, and natural resource and emergency management. 
CAL FIRE cultivates mutually beneficial and cost-effective relationships with all levels of government and the private sector to 
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of public safety programs and mitigate emergencies in the urban, rural, and wildland 
areas of California. 
Because CAL FIRE's programs drive a need for infrastructure investments, CAL FIRE has a capital outlay program to support 
this need. For the specifics on the CAL FIRE's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2461 - STATE FIRE MARSHAL 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) protects life and property through the development and application of fire 
prevention, engineering, education, enforcement, and regulations. 
2461010 - Office of the State Fire Marshal: 
The Office of the State Fire Marshal is comprised of the following six divisions: 
• Code Development and Analysis: The Code Development and Analysis division is responsible for the development and 
adoption of codes relating to fire and life safety used statewide by architects, engineers, design professionals, and the local 
fire and building authorities. This division fosters, promotes, and develops ways and means of protecting life and property 
against fire in many ways, including the adoption and implementation of regulations for statewide application. This division 
prepares the OSFM fire and life safety regulations and building standards for review and adoption into the California Code of 
Regulations, titles 19 and 24. The division assists local fire departments, fire districts, and building departments with the 
application of state laws and regulations. This division also reviews all of California's regulations relating to fire and life safety 
for relevancy, necessity, conflict, duplication, and overlap. 
• Fire and Life Safety: The Fire and Life Safety division is responsible for applying laws and regulations related to fire 
prevention and life safety in state-owned and state-occupied facilities. This is achieved through code compliance inspections 
of new and existing buildings and plan review and construction inspections. The OSFM is responsible for fire and life safety 
in over 45,000 state-owned and state-occupied facilities, which include: state prisons, conservation camps, courts, state 
mental hospitals, state developmental centers, California State University and University of California campuses, and 
California Agricultural Districts. 
• Fire Engineering and Investigations: The Fire Engineering and Investigations division’s primary functions include licensing, 
product approval, fire/explosion investigations, and illegal fireworks enforcement and disposal. The division is responsible for 
11 statewide programs, which include the Building Materials Listing; Portable Fire Extinguishers; Flame Retardant Chemicals 
and Fabrics; Vapor Recovery; Automatic Fire Extinguishing Systems; Fire Safe Cigarettes; Licensing Enforcement and 
Inspection; Lab Accreditation; Motion Picture and Entertainment; Arson and Bomb Investigation; and Fireworks Disposal.

conduct fire/explosion investigations and licensing enforcement. 
• Pipeline Safety: The Pipeline Safety division ensures the safe construction, operation, and maintenance of approximately 
5,400 miles of intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines that transport crude oil, refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, 
etc.), and Highly Volatile Liquids through populated urban areas, ecologically sensitive areas, and other high consequence 
areas. Pipelines that fall under the Pipeline Safety division authority are pipelines that transport hazardous liquids between 
facilities, such as offshore platforms, production fields, refineries, storage terminals, and marine terminals. This division is 
additionally charged with implementing investigations for failures, explosions, and fires on intrastate pipelines, and assisting 
on investigations for interstate pipelines. The Certified Unified Program Agencies program is responsible for ensuring the 
implementation of the California Fire Code Hazardous Materials Management Plan/Hazardous Materials Inventory 
Statement (HMMP/HMIS) and the Aboveground Petroleum Storage Act program elements. The HMMP/HMIS program ties in 
closely with the Hazardous Release Response Plan and Inventory or Hazardous Materials Business Plan program. The 
Firefighter Equipment and Foam program is tasked to monitor the use of Perfluoroalky and Polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS) throughout the state at designated facilities, and issue waivers to refineries and terminals for fixed suppression 
systems meeting identified criteria. 
• State Fire Training: The State Fire Training division administers the California Fire Service Training and Education System 
and the Fire Service Training and Education Program for federal, state, and local firefighters. The division oversees a 
California Fire Academy System for over 65 training academies that represent a partnership with the fire departments, 
community colleges, and the OSFM. State Fire Training administers a professional certification system for fire service 
personnel and receives program guidance from the State Board of Fire Services. 
• Wildfire Planning and Engineering: The Wildfire Planning and Engineering division will be transitioning into the new 
Community Wildfire Preparedness and Mitigation Division established by the passage of Chapter 225, Statutes of 2021 (AB 
9). The division is responsible for various community-level fire prevention and preparedness programs including defensible 
space, home hardening, fire planning, land use planning, utility fire mitigation, fire prevention grants, fire hazard mapping, 
incident data and statistics, and damage inspection. 
2461019 - California Underground Facilities Safe Excavation Board: 
Also called the “Dig Safe Board,” created by the passage of Chapter 809, Statutes of 2016 (SB 661), the Board works on 
issues related to the state's "Call Before You Dig" law, which requires excavators and buried infrastructure owners to coordinate 
to prevent infrastructure damage and unsafe outcomes. The Dig Safe Board is charged with coordinating the state’s safe 
excavation outreach and education efforts, developing safe excavation standards, investigating accidents and working with 
partner state agencies to enforce the “Call Before You Dig” law. The Dig Safe Board was transferred to the Office of Energy 
Infrastructure Safety on January 1, 2022 to comply with the requirements of Chapter 307, Statutes of 2020 (SB 865). 
2465 - FIRE PROTECTION 
CAL FIRE provides fire protection to keep damages to life, property, and natural resources within social, political, and economic 
constraints. The objective is to attack fires quickly and aggressively in areas where CAL FIRE has assumed primary direct 
protection responsibility by virtue of law, contract, or agreement until the fire is under control. The level of initial attack and 
follow-up action is relative to values threatened and control difficulty with the goal to control all unwanted fires within the first 
burning period. 
2465010 - Fire Prevention: 
This program is responsible for implementation of the Strategic Fire Plan, fire engineering, law enforcement, fire suppression 
cost recovery, and fire prevention education. This program focuses on the most effective methods, materials, and procedures to 
mitigate hazard and to enforce pertinent laws that deter and mitigate fires. More specifically, efforts focus on what needs to be 
done before a wildland fire starts to reduce the costs of firefighting, property loss, injury to the public and fire fighters, and 
damage to the environment. 
2465019 - Fire Control: 
The objective of this program is to detect, respond to, and suppress wildland fires in or threatening the State Responsibility 
Area. The heart of the effort is an aggressive initial attack strategy. CAL FIRE's goal is to contain 95 percent of all wildfires to 
ten acres or less. This is achieved through detection, ground attack, air attack, and mutual aid using fire engines, fire crews, 
bulldozers, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft. 
2465028 - Cooperative Fire Protection: 
CAL FIRE provides a full range of fire protection services to local, county, state, and federal agencies throughout California 
through the administration of over 100 cooperative fire protection service agreements. Additionally, there are six long standing 
agreements wherein counties provide wildland fire protection on behalf of the Department. 
2465037 - Conservation Camps: 
CAL FIRE, in cooperation with the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Divisions of Adult Parole Operations and 
Division of Juvenile Justice, operates 30 conservation camps throughout the state with capacity to house 152 fire crews. CAL 
FIRE operates seven permanent Fire Centers, six seasonal Fire Centers, and one Parole Training Center with the California

Conservation Corps throughout the state that house 28 fire crews. CAL FIRE also operates in conjunction with the California 
National Guard to staff seven Fire Centers with a total of 10 fire crews.  Additionally, CAL FIRE is currently authorized to 
operate 16 CAL FIRE Firefighter Crews located at seven different Fire Centers. These crews are available to respond to all 
types of emergencies including wildfires, floods, search and rescue, and earthquakes. When not responding to emergencies, 
the crews engage in hazardous fuels reduction, conservation related work projects, and prescribed fire project work to protect 
the community and resources of California. 
2465046 - Emergency Fire Suppression: 
CAL FIRE incurs additional emergency fire suppression expenditures when budgeted initial attack forces are unable to cope 
with a wildland fire within the initial attack period.  Portions of these costs may be reimbursed in the fiscal year the expense was 
incurred or in a future fiscal year via Fire Management Assistance Grants provided by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency or through cost shares provided by other government entities. In addition, CAL FIRE may recover portions of this cost 
through civil cost recovery actions authorized by state statutes. 
2470 - RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
California's state and private forest, range, watershed lands, and urban forests provide multiple human, climate, and 
environmental benefits. The objective of this program is to maintain and enhance those benefits and to minimize damage to 
these resources from natural catastrophes and human development. Objectives are met by regulation of timber harvesting, 
coordination of climate and forest restoration related activities for the forest sector, technical assistance to non-industrial 
landowners, operation of state demonstration forests, operation of forest nurseries, vegetation management projects, and 
administration of federal forestry assistance programs. 
2470010 - Resources Protection and Improvement:
