incentive to retire their unwanted vehicle at any time and for any reason. The Bureau, in cooperation with the California Air

The Department of Real Estate makes sure that individuals who wish to engage in real estate business and act in the capacity 
of, or advertise as, a real estate broker or salesperson within California meet specified qualifications, and ensures licensees 
meet minimum education standards and requirements. The Department investigates the actions of any person acting in the 
capacity of a real estate licensee, performs financial compliance audits of licensees and subdividers, administratively 
prosecutes violations of the Real Estate Law and Subdivided Lands Law, and provides victims of real estate fraud with financial 
recovery per limitations set by statute. The Department protects the public against fraud and misrepresentation in the sale or 
lease of subdivided land through the issuance of public reports that disclose vital information to prospective purchasers of 
subdivision interests.
