The Office is also \nresponsible for posting links on its website to other state agency websites where the public may find regulations that have been \nrecently filed with the Secretary of State, but have not yet gone into effect. The Office assists state regulatory agencies through \na formal training program, as well as through other less formal methods, to understand and comply with the Administrative \nProcedure Act. Through its Reference Attorney service, the Office provides direct legal advice to state agencies and members \nof the public regarding California rulemaking law. \nIn response to petitions submitted by interested persons, the Office evaluates whether rules being used by state agencies \nconstitute underground regulations, i.e., rules that have not been properly adopted pursuant to the requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, and issues formal determinations reflecting those evaluations. \nThe Office oversees the publication and distribution, in print and on the Internet, of the California Code of Regulations and the \nCalifornia Regulatory Notice Register. \nGOVERNMENT OPERATIONS\n7900 Public Employees' Retirement System - Continued\n2020-21 STATE BUDGET — GOP 83\n* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range.

The Conservancy achieves its mission by developing and implementing\nprograms that acquire environmentally sensitive land, provide grants or directly fund soil erosion prevention and watershed\nrestoration, improve stream environments and wildlife habitats, and improve water quality. The Conservancy also balances\nthese activities with programs to improve public access and recreational opportunities in an environmentally sound manner by\nacquiring lakefront property, constructing pedestrian and bike paths, and building public access facilities.\nThe Conservancy is also a key implementing agency of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) which is a 1997\nagreement between California, Nevada, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the federal government, local governments, and\nvarious private entities to commit $908 million over 10 years to a list of acquisition and capital improvement projects needed to\nachieve environmental goals in the Basin. The EIP is updated periodically to include more refined estimates of projects,\nmodifications in the scope of identified projects, and inclusion of new projects. The 2008-2018 EIP was finalized in July 2009.\nBecause the Conservancy's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Conservancy has a capital outlay program\nto support this need. For the specifics on the Conservancy's capital outlay program see \"Infrastructure Overview.\"",

Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.\n6300\nState Contributions to the State Teachers' Retirement System\nThe state makes General Fund payments to the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS).\nThe annual General Fund contribution to the CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program is based on 2.017 percent of members'\ncreditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding calendar year. Current law also provides for an\nadditional state contribution when the Teachers' Retirement Fund has an unfunded obligation for benefits that were in place on\nJuly 1, 1990. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (AB 1469) increased this additional state contribution, to be phased in over three\nyears beginning in 2014-15, to 4.311 percent of members' creditable earnings. The Teachers' Retirement Board can increase\nthe state's contribution by 0.5 percent of payroll each year to meet the funding need.\nThe Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA), established in 1989, provides annual supplemental payments (in\nquarterly installments) to members whose purchasing power has fallen below a specified percent of the original purchasing\npower allowance. Chapter 751, Statutes of 2008 (AB 1389) increased the amount of supplemental purchase power protection\npayments from the SBMA to up to 85 percent of the value of the original benefit. The Teachers' Retirement Board is required to\nset SBMA benefits between an amount necessary to preserve 80 to 85 percent of retirees' purchasing power, pursuant to\nCalSTRS regulations, and subject to the availability of funds. The General Fund provides a statutory transfer to the SBMA of an\namount equal to 2.5 percent of the members' creditable earnings of the fiscal year ending in the immediately preceding\ncalendar year, less a specified amount that is currently capped at $72 million. Payments are made on October 15 and April 15\nof each year. If, at any time, the funds in the SBMA are insufficient to support 80 percent purchasing power, the Teachers'\nRetirement Board can: (1) transfer funds from the Teachers' Retirement Fund if no CalSTRS unfunded obligation exists, (2)\nincrease employer contributions, or (3) reduce the SBMA benefit payment.",

As the independent auditor, the state law exclusively grants the State \nAuditor full access to all records of state and local agencies, special districts, school districts, and any publicly-created entity. \nGENERAL GOVERNMENT\n8830 California Law Revision Commission - Continued\n2021-22 STATE BUDGET — GG 69\n* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.\nThe State Auditor conducts performance, financial, or compliance audits that are either mandated by statute or requested by \nthe Legislature through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee (JLAC). Further, the State Auditor is responsible for annually \nconducting California's statewide Single Audit - a combination of the independent audit of the State's basic financial statements \nand the independent audit of numerous federal programs administered by California. The Single Audit is federally required as a \ncondition for California to receive billions in federal funds each year. In 2011-12, the Legislature enacted a program that \nrequires the State Auditor to conduct pilot audits of the procurement practices of six trial courts in 2012-13 and thereafter \nbiennially audit the procurement practices of the Administrative Office of the Courts and five judicial branch entities - which \nincludes trial courts, Appellate Courts, and the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. \nThe State Auditor also identifies statewide issues or specific government entities as being at-high risk for waste, fraud, abuse, \nand mismanagement or that have major challenges related to efficiency and effectiveness. The State Auditor has the authority \nto conduct evaluations of those issues and entities identified as being high risk. Similar to the state high-risk program, Chapter \n451, Statutes of 2011 (AB 187), also authorizes the State Auditor, to the extent resources are available, to identify local \ngovernment agencies - including city, county, or special districts or publicly-created entities - as being at-high risk for the \npotential of waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement or that have major challenges associated with their economy, efficiency, or \neffectiveness. Further, if approved by the JLAC, the State Auditor can audit these identified local entities. \nAdditionally, under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the State Auditor's office has broad authority to perform \nindependent investigations into allegations of improper governmental activities by employees at state agencies and courts. The \nState Auditor's office administers California's Whistleblower Hotline that enables the public to report allegations of improper \nacts committed by the courts, state agencies, departments, or employees, as defined by law. \nThe Voters FIRST Act, approved by voters in November 2008 as Proposition 11, requires the State Auditor to initiate an \napplication process for selecting the members of a 14-member Citizens Redistricting Commission (Commission) every 10 \nyears. The State Auditor develops regulations to implement the application and selection process of the Commission and \nconducts comprehensive outreach to prospective applicants to serve on the Commission.",

Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. \nChapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially \nunable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. \nThe Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent \nfunding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was \nimplemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This \nimplementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The \ncounty contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations.

Each county makes quarterly payments \nto the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted \nby amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act \nof 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the \ncounties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial \nCourt Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are \ndeposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of \ncourt facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities \nbased upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. \nThe mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, \nimpartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United \nStates, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. \nBecause the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay \nprogram to support this need.

Dental care was added \nin 1982. \nThe 2019-20 employer contribution for health premiums for employees hired by the state on and prior to December 31, 2016, \nmaintains the average 100/90 percent contribution formula established in Government Code Section 22871 for fully vested \nmembers.

The OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, protecting\nagainst, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of all hazards and threats.\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, the OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and\ncoordinates with federal agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private\nsector resources in emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction\nrelies first on its own resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. The OES' plans and programs are\ncoordinated with those of the federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within\nCalifornia.\n\nDuring an emergency, the OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's\nresponsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal\nassistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, the OES is responsible for the\ndevelopment and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes\nprevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.\n\nThe OES implements the state homeland security strategy by overseeing the State Threat Assessment System (STAS),\nwhich includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center (STAC). The STAS is comprised of four regional and\none major urban area Fusion Centers that assist in the detection, prevention, investigation, and response to criminal and\nterrorist activity; and information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector\npartners. The STAC operates as the state's information-sharing clearinghouse for strategic threat analysis, counter-\nterrorism, situational awareness reporting, and case analysis for statewide leadership, agencies, and public safety\ncommunity. Further, the OES improves the criminal justice system in California by providing financial and technical\nassistance to local governments, state agencies, and the private sector for homeland security, public safety, and victim\nservices.\n\nBecause the OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the department has a capital outlay program to\nsupport this need.

      "description": "Article VI of the Constitution creates the Supreme Court of California and the Courts of Appeal to exercise the judicial power of \nthe state at the appellate level. Article VI also creates the Judicial Council of California to administer the state's judicial system. \nChapter 869, Statutes of 1997, created the California Habeas Corpus Resource Center to represent any person financially \nunable to employ appellate counsel in capital cases. \nThe Lockyer-Isenberg Trial Court Funding Act of 1997 (Chapter 850, Statutes of 1997) provided a stable and consistent \nfunding source for the trial courts. Beginning with fiscal year 1997-98, consolidation of the costs of trial court operation was \nimplemented at the state level, with the exception of facility, revenue collection, and local judicial benefit costs. This \nimplementation capped the counties' general purpose revenue contributions to trial court costs at a revised 1994-95 level. The \ncounty contributions become part of the Trial Court Trust Fund, which supports all trial court operations. Fine and penalty \nrevenue collected by each county is retained or distributed in accordance with statute. Each county makes quarterly payments \nto the Trial Court Trust Fund equal to the fine and penalty revenue received by the state General Fund in 1994-95, as adjusted \nby amounts equivalent to specified fine and fee revenues that counties benefited from in 2003-04. The Trial Court Facilities Act \nof 2002 (Chapter 1082, statutes of 2002) provided a process for the responsibility for court facilities to be transferred from the \ncounties to the state by July 1, 2007, which was extended to December 31, 2009, by Chapter 9, Statutes of 2008. The Trial \nCourt Facilities Act of 2002 also established several new revenue sources, effective on January 1, 2003. These revenues are \ndeposited into the State Court Facilities Construction Fund for the purpose of funding the construction and maintenance of \ncourt facilities throughout the state. Counties contribute revenues for the ongoing operation and maintenance of court facilities \nbased upon historical expenditures for facilities transferred to the state. \nThe mission of the Judicial Branch is to resolve disputes arising under the law and to interpret and apply the law consistently, \nimpartially, and independently to protect the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitutions of California and the United \nStates, in a fair, accessible, effective, and efficient manner. \nBecause the Judicial Branch's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Judicial Branch has a capital outlay \nprogram to support this need.

Diligent execution of the Commission's responsibilities since its inception in 1938 has resulted \nin the generation of over $11.6 billion in revenues, while protecting and enhancing the public's ability to enjoy those lands and \nresources. \nConsisting of the Lieutenant Governor, the State Controller, and the Governor's Director of Finance, the California State Lands \nCommission serves as a trustee for the people of the state, managing California's sovereign public trust lands and resources, \nwhich the state received upon admission into the Union in 1850. It also manages other lands subsequently conveyed to the \nstate by the federal government (commonly known as \"school\" lands) and oversees the management of public trust lands \nlegislatively granted in trust to over 70 local jurisdictions. These grants encourage development and use of the state's \ntidelands, consistent with the public trust doctrine, and typically require grantees to reinvest revenues produced from the \ngranted lands back into the trust. \nPublic trust or \"sovereign\" lands include the beds of all natural and navigable waterways, including non-tidal rivers, streams and \nlakes, and tide and submerged lands within tidal rivers, sloughs, bays, and the Pacific Ocean extending from the mean high \ntide line seaward to the three-mile offshore limit and totaling over four and one-half million acres. In addition to sovereign lands, \nthe Commission manages \"school\" lands, which were granted to California by the federal government under the Act of March \n3, 1853 (10 Stat. 244) for the purpose of supporting public education in California. School lands include the 16th and 36th \nsections of each township (with the exception of lands already reserved for public use or previously taken by private claims) \nand lands known to be mineral in character. Of the five and one-half million acres of school lands originally granted to the state, \nonly about 458,843 acres remain in state ownership, and these are mostly concentrated in the California desert. The \nCommission also retains a reserved mineral interest in approximately 790,000 acres of sold school lands.",

State Fund is governed by a board of directors with authority comparable to that of the governing\nbody of a private insurance carrier. State Fund has its own separate budget process that is presented to its board of\ndirectors for approval. \n \nState Fund's purpose is to provide fairly priced workers' compensation insurance, make California workplaces safe, restore\ninjured workers, and operate as the continuously available market for workers' compensation insurance for employers\nlocated in California. Pursuant to the Insurance Code, State Fund is to be self-supporting with revenues from premiums on\npolicies written and from investment income. State Fund does not receive any financial support from the State of California,\nand the State is not liable for any obligations of State Fund. Almost all of State Fund's employees are hired through the\nCalifornia civil service process and are actually employees of the State. \n \nState Fund is considered a related organization to the State of California because State Fund was created by the State and\nbecause the Governor appoints a voting majority of State Fund's board of directors. However, the State of California is not\nfinancially liable or responsible for the operations or solvency of State Fund. \n \nMost of the state agencies and departments of the State of California are legally uninsured for workers' compensation\ncoverage and benefits for injured employees. Separate from its issuance of workers' compensation insurance policies to\nprivate employers, State Fund has been engaged by the California Department of Human Resources to provide workers'\ncompensation claims administration services for these legally uninsured departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and\nother subdivisions of the State of California under a Master Services Agreement. Under this agreement, the State provides a\ndeposit out of which State Fund pays compensation benefits to injured State workers and medical benefits to health\nproviders, and State Fund is reimbursed by state agencies for benefit amounts paid plus a service fee equal to the cost of\nthese services. \n \nFor informational purposes only, the following table provides summary data on actual and estimated workers' compensation\nclaims costs paid by state agencies.

Hastings is the oldest law school and one of the largest public law schools in the United States. The business of\nthe college is managed by the Board of Directors. The Board has 11 directors: one is an heir or representative of S.C.\nHastings and the other 10 are appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. Directors serve for 12-year terms.\nHastings is approved by the American Bar Association and is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges\nand Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Hastings is a member of the Association of American\nLaw Schools. The Juris Doctor degree is granted by the Regents of the University of California and is signed by the\nPresident of the University of California and the Chancellor and Dean of Hastings College of the Law. \n \nBecause department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department assesses its need for new or\nrenovated facilities and has significant input into capital planning and the capital outlay program to support this need.

All campuses offer undergraduate and graduate\ninstruction for professional and occupational goals and liberal education programs. For undergraduate programs, each\ncampus requires a basic program of general education regardless of the major selected by the student. In addition to\nmaster's-level graduate programs, the CSU offers doctorate programs in education, nursing practice, and physical therapy.\nThe CSU also offers some doctoral degrees jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. \n \nThe university is governed by the Board of Trustees, which includes the following 25 members: 5 ex officio members, 16\nmembers appointed by the Governor to eight-year terms, and 4 members appointed by the Governor to two-year terms (2\nstudent representatives, 1 voting and 1 non-voting, 1 faculty representative, and 1 alumni representative). The Trustees\nappoint the Chancellor and the campus presidents. The Trustees, the Chancellor, and the presidents develop systemwide\npolicy. The systemwide Academic Senate, made up of elected faculty representatives from the campuses, recommends\nacademic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor. \n \nThe program goals include: \n \nProviding instruction in the liberal arts and sciences, the professions, applied fields that require more than two years of\ncollege education, and teacher education.\nProviding public services to the people of California.\nProviding services to students enrolled in the university.\nPreparing administrative leaders for elementary and secondary schools and community colleges by awarding the\ndoctorate degree in education.\nPreparing physical therapists by awarding the doctorate degree in physical therapy.\nPreparing faculty to teach in postsecondary nursing programs by awarding the doctorate degree in nursing practice.\n \nBecause department programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each department has a related capital outlay\nprogram to support this need.
