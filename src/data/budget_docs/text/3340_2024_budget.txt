3340   California Conservation Corps 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) provides young women and men the opportunity to work hard responding to fires, 
floods and other disasters, restoring California's environment, and installing clean energy and energy conservation measures at 
public facilities throughout the state. Through their service, the corpsmembers gain life, work, and academic skills to become 
strong workers and citizens. 
In addition to the CCC, there are also 14 local conservation corps located in metropolitan communities throughout the state that 
are annually certified by the CCC, and engage young people in conservation, recycling, education, and training activities. 
Because the CCC's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the CCC has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on the CCC's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2360 - TRAINING AND WORK PROGRAM 
This Program focuses on five areas: 
Natural Resource Work: Corpsmembers protect and enhance the state's natural resources through park development, trail 
construction, tree planting, fire hazard reduction, watershed improvement, wildlife habitat enhancement, removal of non-native 
vegetation, meadow restoration, energy and water auditing and retrofitting, irrigation system installation, and drought-tolerant 
and other landscaping. 
Disaster Response: Corpsmembers are dispatched to fires, assisting with initial attack, mop-up and logistical support; floods, 
filling sandbags, reinforcing levees and stabilizing hillsides; earthquakes, removing hazards and staffing disaster assistance 
centers; oil spill clean-up; snow removal; search and rescue operations; pest infestation eradication; and homeland security 
assistance. 
Corpsmember Education: Corpsmembers are provided opportunities to advance their academic skills while in the CCC through 
local adult and charter schools and community colleges. 
Corpsmember Development and Training: The CCC stresses the development of both a work and service ethic, which includes 
teamwork, self-discipline, leadership, and giving back to California. Corpsmembers learn conservation principles and career 
planning. The CCC also offers training in trail building, first aid, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, and 
firefighting certification, which can lead to internship opportunities with various employers in California. 
Corpsmember Career Pathways: The CCC dedicates resources to help Corpsmembers transition out of the program to 
meaningful career pathways, including but not limited to: higher education, trade schools, apprenticeships, careers with local/
state/federal agencies, etc., to apply their skillsets and build financial independence.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The California Conservation Corps (CCC) operates 26 facilities statewide, including 10 residential and 16 non-residential 
facilities in both urban and rural areas. These facilities enable the CCC to achieve its mission of providing employment, training, 
and educational opportunities to young adults. The facilities also allow the CCC to assist federal, state and local agencies, as 
well as nonprofit entities, with the conservation of California's natural resources. 
The CCC residential facilities house 80 to 100 corpsmembers each and operate 24 hours a day, bringing young people 
together from across the state, and increasing capacity for emergency response and conservation projects. Non-residential 
centers range in size from 30 to 60 corpsmembers and are located in both urban and rural communities throughout California.
