3900    Air Resources Board
 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These
plans include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board
and local air pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the
Secretary for Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020
and at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249,
Statutes of 2016 (SB 32). 
 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
 
 
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE 
 
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as
follows: 
Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations limiting criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and toxic air
contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assess the effectiveness of established
procedures.
Develop testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuel additives, and test
equipment to ensure emission standards are met.
 
3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE 
 
The Stationary Source Program works with air pollution control districts and business and scientific communities to reduce
emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as follows: 
Develop, implement, and enforce measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by the
California Clean Air Act and work with local air pollution control districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient
air quality standards.
Identify substances that are toxic air contaminants and develop, implement, and enforce measures to control toxic air
contaminant emissions from stationary sources.
 
3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 40 percent
below 1990 levels by 2030, as follows: 
Develop, implement, and enforce measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from mobile and
stationary sources, in accordance with AB 32 and SB 32.
Enforce laws and develop, implement, and enforce regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission
reductions and other requirements of AB 32 and SB 32.
Develop, implement, and oversee programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, and
other incentive programs.
 
3515 - SUBVENTION 
 
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air pollution control districts to encourage and support effective
district programs. The state's 35 local air pollution control districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary
sources of air pollution in California. 
 
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM 
 
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing
competitive funding to advance implementation of zero/near-zero emission warehouses and technology. The intent of the
program is to develop state-of-the-art facilities with the lowest possible emissions.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW
 
The Air Resources Board has 61 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 60 sites are leased. Of these
leased sites, 43 support air-monitoring stations and 17 sites support an array of vehicle testing, research, planning,
enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs; one of the support sites is also equipped with
an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air Resources Board oversees to support its
statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct
research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air Resources Board leadership role related to
greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.
