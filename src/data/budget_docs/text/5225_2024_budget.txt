PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4500 - CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Corrections and Rehabilitation Administration program is to provide policy direction, accountability, 
administrative oversight, and support for the overall success of all adult correctional and rehabilitation programs. The program 
consists of the Office of the Secretary; Legislative Affairs; Public and Employee Communications; Internal Affairs; Audits and 
Court Compliance; Victim and Survivor Rights and Services; Support Services; Enterprise Information Services; Labor 
Relations; Regulations and Policy; Research; Legal Affairs; Leasing and Facility Management; Appeals; and the Office of the 
Ombudsman. 
4505 - PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT 
The Peace Officer Selection and Employee Development program is responsible for planning, organizing, analyzing, and 
managing peace officer selection through the recruitment, application, testing, background investigation, and medical/
psychological screening processes. The program is also responsible for academy training and employee development for all 
departmental staff. 
4510 - DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES 
The objective of the Department of Justice Legal Services program is to provide transparency for the cost of legal services 
provided by the Department of Justice to CDCR. 
4515 - JUVENILE OPERATIONS AND JUVENILE OFFENDER PROGRAMS 
The Department previously accepted commitments from California courts when the person to be committed met age 
requirements, could materially benefit from institutional programs, and if there were adequate facilities available to care for the 
individual. 
The objective of the Juvenile Operations and Juvenile Offender program was to operate safe and secure juvenile facilities and 
perform tasks related to routine day-to-day operations of the facilities and camp, including, feeding, clothing, and facility 
operations. In addition, this program provided staff training, incarcerated youth intake and court services, population 
management services, facility maintenance, and maintained incarcerated youth master files. This program oversaw operations 
for three facilities and one conservation camp. 
Treatment programs began with diagnostic studies, program assignment, objective setting and progress evaluation, and post 
release planning for each incarcerated youth. Based on the results of this process, various counseling and evidence-based 
treatment programs were recommended, including mental health and other cognitive behavior programs (i.e., anger interruption 
therapy, sex offender treatment, general population outpatient services, and substance abuse treatment programs), camp 
programs, and work employability programs. These evidence-based programs were designed to promote positive social 
behavior and reduce recidivism and relapse. 
This program is ramping down operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on 
June 30, 2023, pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92). 
4520 - JUVENILE ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Education Services Branch of the Division of Juvenile Justice operated as a local education agency known as the 
California Education Authority. Its mission was to empower each student to become a civil, responsible, employable, and 
knowledgeable lifelong learner for successful transition to the community upon release. 
The Juvenile Academic and Vocational Education programs were accredited by the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges and included core academic and career/technical preparation high school courses, general education development 
preparation, basic skills enhancement, and college preparation. All students were required to meet the California Common 
Core State Standards and earn the appropriate number of course credits to graduate. Supplemental services included special 
education, English learner services, basic skills enhancement, library services, character development courses, and high 
school credit for work experience. 
This program is ramping down operations in the 2023-24 fiscal year given the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice on 
June 30, 2023, pursuant to Chapter 337, Statutes of 2020 (SB 823) and Chapter 18, Statutes of 2021 (SB 92). 
4525 - JUVENILE HEALTH CARE SERVICES 
The objective of the Juvenile Health Care Services program was to provide medical, dental, and mental health care consistent 
with adopted standards for the quality and scope of services within a custodial environment. The program strove to achieve this 
mission by providing cost-effective, timely, and competent care. In addition, Juvenile Health Care Services was responsible for 
overseeing and implementing the Integrated Behavioral Treatment Model, which used evidence-based principles of a cognitive 
behavioral treatment program to guide the development of the best program for the unique needs of the youth and young adult 
population.

degree of successful reintegration and release to society of incarcerated people paroled from state prison. The program is 
responsible for providing direct supervision, surveillance, and apprehension of the state's parolee population when certain case 
factors exist. The Division of Adult Parole Operations' supervision strategies utilize the California Parole Supervision and 
Reintegration Model, which incorporates evidence-based practices to elicit long-term behavioral changes to reduce recidivism. 
Standard and specialized caseloads and the degree of supervision are determined by case factors related to the incarcerated 
person's risk and current service needs. Case supervision, reassessment, and reclassification are regularly scheduled based 
on parolee behavior and stability in the community. Other components of supervision include the Sex Offender Management 
Program, which incorporates the control and containment model strategy as required by statute, and Global Positioning System 
(GPS) monitoring for all sex offenders. 
Another integral aspect of this program is the Community Transition Program, which conducts pre-release assessments and 
services in each prison and includes the identification of parolee needs to match them with state and local programs to support 
successful transition into local communities. 
4560 - PAROLE OPERATIONS - ADULT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS 
Rehabilitative Programs and Parole Operations - Adult Community Based Programs utilize a variety of rehabilitative and

served a certain amount of time based on their commitment offense; incarcerated persons who were under the age of 26 at the 
time of their offense, and have served a minimum of 15, 20, or 25 years of continuous incarceration, depending on the 
sentence, or under the age of 18 if sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, and are eligible for a Youth Offender 
Parole hearing; and incarcerated persons eligible for the Elderly Parole Program. 
The Board conducts medical parole hearings and hearings for certain parole violators. Additionally, the Board approves 
transfers of foreign citizens who are incarcerated in California to their native countries where they are to serve the remainder of

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
As one of the largest departments in state government, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) operates 32 
state-owned institutions and 35 firefighting and conservation camps. CDCR's infrastructure includes more than 41 million 
square feet of state-owned building space on more than 21,000 acres of land (33 square miles) statewide. 
CDCR and the Board of State and Community Corrections jointly administer several programs to partially finance the design 
and construction of county correctional facilities. The programs consist of Adult Local Criminal Justice and Local Youth 
Offender Rehabilitation facilities. Legislation is comprised of the 2007 Senate Bill 81 (Youth), the 2007 Assembly Bill 900 
(Adult), the 2012 Senate Bill 1022 (Adult), the 2014 Senate Bill 863 (Adult), and the 2016 Senate Bill 844 (Adult). 
Approximately $294 million has been awarded to 19 counties to build or remodel Youth Offender facilities and approximately 
$2.158 billion has been awarded to 54 counties to build or remodel Adult Local Criminal facilities. CDCR oversees 42 of these 
projects totaling approximately $1.517 billion authorized from Assembly Bill 900, Senate Bill 81, and Senate Bill 1022.
