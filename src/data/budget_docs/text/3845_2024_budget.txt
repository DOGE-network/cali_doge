3845   San Diego River Conservancy 
The mission of the San Diego River Conservancy is to implement the San Diego River Conservancy Act through programs 
emphasizing Land Conservation, Recreation and Education, Natural and Cultural Resources, Water Quality and Natural Flood 
Conveyance, Organizational Capacity, and the San Diego Rivers Watershed Consortium. This Conservancy’s mission will be 
accomplished in part by building with our partners the San Diego River Trail stretching over 52 miles from the headwaters in 
Julian to the Pacific Ocean. The Conservancy has established advisory panels to assist in restoring and enhancing three 
nearby watersheds: the Otay River, Sweetwater River, and Tijuana River. Working with stakeholders within these watersheds 
fosters collaboration among governments, public agencies and nonprofit organizations, and leverages grant funding to achieve 
an array of conservation objectives for the region with an emphasis on native habitat restoration and mitigating the impacts of 
climate change, seawater intrusion in local watersheds, sea level rise, and the risk of wildfire and flooding.
