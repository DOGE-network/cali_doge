3720   California Coastal Commission 
The California Coastal Commission, comprised of 12 voting members appointed by the Governor, the Senate Rules 
Committee, and the Speaker of the Assembly, was created by voter initiative in 1972 and was made permanent by the 
California Coastal Act of 1976 (Coastal Act). The Coastal Act calls for the protection and enhancement of public access and 
recreation, marine resources, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, marine water quality, agriculture, and scenic resources; 
and makes provisions for coastal-dependent industrial and energy development. The Commission is also designated the 
principal state coastal management agency for the purpose of administering the federal Coastal Zone Management Act in 
California and has exclusive regulatory authority over federal activities such as permits, leases, federal development projects, 
and other federal actions that could affect coastal zone resources and that would not otherwise be subject to state control.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2730 - COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
The objectives of the Coastal Management Program are to implement coastal resources conservation through planning and 
regulation. Activities include: 
• Reviewing and approval of local coastal programs (LCPs), port master plans, university long-range development plans, and 
any amendments to such plans, for consistency with the Coastal Act. 
• Reviewing coastal development permit applications for new development in areas without a certified LCP, areas of 
permanently retained jurisdiction (e.g., tidelands, submerged lands, and public trust lands) and limited categories of local 
coastal development permit actions that can be appealed to the Commission. 
• Monitoring and enforcement of coastal development permits. 
• Reviewing federal activities for consistency with the Coastal Act. 
• Protecting and expanding opportunities for public coastal access and recreation. 
• Implementing a coastal water quality protection program. 
• Providing technical information and assistance to support effective coastal management. 
• Implementing a coastal and ocean resource public education program. 
• Addressing coastal energy issues including, but not limited to, offshore oil and gas development, offshore wind projects, 
electricity generating power plant expansion and development, and siting and development of liquefied natural gas facilities. 
• Providing administrative support including accounting, budgeting, business services, support services, information 
technology, and human resources services.
