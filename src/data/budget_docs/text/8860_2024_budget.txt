PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6770 - STATE BUDGET 
To ensure the financial integrity of the state through the planned allocation of state resources, the Department of Finance 
advises the Governor on the fiscal condition of the state and prepares the annual Governor's Budget. The Governor's Budget 
contains past year actual expenditures and revenues, current year estimated expenditures and revenues, and proposed 
expenditures and estimated revenues for the next fiscal year. After the budget is enacted, the Department of Finance assists in 
the administration of the budget. The Department of Finance also conducts performance reviews of state agencies and 
programs, recommends ways to lower the costs of state government and to better serve the public within existing resources, 
and provides fiscal analyses of bills introduced in the Legislature and makes recommendations to the Governor. Federal Funds 
Accountability and Cost Tracking functions support the coordination of the tracking, reporting, transparency, and accountability 
for federal stimulus and disaster recovery funds, while also performing certain federal disaster cost recovery activities in 
coordination with the California Office of Emergency Services. Basic and applied economic and tax research functions support 
the revenue estimates required for the development of the state financial plan, for the analysis of financial legislation, and the 
evaluation of economic trends or other fiscal developments which affect the state. Basic and applied demographic research 
functions provide data to support the workload estimates of state agencies. 
6780 - STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS 
The Department of Finance systematically reviews and evaluates state-administered and financed programs. The Office of 
State Audits and Evaluations assists the Director of Finance in fulfilling the statutory responsibilities for supervision over all 
matters concerning the financial and business policies of the state by conducting financial audits and by performing critical 
examinations of state programs and policies including the oversight activities associated with the dissolution of redevelopment 
agencies. 
6785 - STATEWIDE ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONSULTING AND TRAINING 
The Department of Finance is responsible for devising and maintaining a modern and uniform system of statewide accounting. 
The Fiscal Systems and Consulting Unit sets statewide fiscal and accounting policies and procedures.  The unit provides fiscal 
and accounting training, advice, and consulting services to departments to ensure that the state's assets are protected, and 
that accurate and timely financial information is maintained.  The Department of Finance participates in the development of 
statewide financial systems.
