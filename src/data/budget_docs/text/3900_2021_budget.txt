3900   Air Resources Board 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources and industrial sources established by the Board and local air 
pollution control districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility, in coordination with the Secretary for 
Environmental Protection, to develop measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 40 
percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 (AB 32), and Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 
32). The Air Resources Board also implements the Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's 
most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with air 
pollution control districts, the business community, scientists, community representatives and other stakeholders to implement 
its programs. 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES 
• Zero Emission Vehicle Package—The Budget includes $883 million General Fund and $652 million special funds in 2021-22 
for the Air Resources Board as part of a $3.9 billion package to equitably scale the zero emission vehicle market and 
accelerate the state toward meeting its climate and transportation goals. This includes funding to support: zero emission 
drayage trucks, transit buses, and school buses; the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project; Clean Trucks, Buses, and Off-Road 
Equipment; Clean Cars 4 All and other equity programs; and near-zero heavy-duty trucks. 
• Incentives for Alternatives to Agricultural Burning in the San Joaquin Valley—The Budget includes $180 million General Fund 
in 2021-22 for the Air Resources Board to provide incentives to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley to promote the use of 
alternatives to open agricultural burning to facilitate completing the phase-out by the end of 2024. 
• Bolstering Heavy-Duty Mobile Source Testing & Enforcement—The Budget includes $2.9 million Air Pollution Control Fund in 
2021-22 to expand the Air Resources Board’s heavy-duty mobile source testing program to address non-compliance with 
state and federal emissions standards. 
• Continuing Resources to Support Implementation of the Community Air Protection Program (AB 617)—The Budget includes 
$1 million Air Pollution Control Fund in 2021-22 to partially fund the Air Resources Board’s implementation of the AB 617 
program through September 2021. 
• Wildfire and Forest Resilience Package—Chapter 14, Statutes of 2021 (SB 85) provided $536 million one-time General Fund 
in 2020-21 for a comprehensive package to increase the pace and scale of forest health activities and reduce wildfire risk. In 
total, the Budget includes a $1.5 billion wildfire prevention and forest resilience investment over three years ($536 million in 
2020 21, $458 million in 2021-22, and $500 million in 2022 23). Allocations for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 budgets will be

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE 
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as 
follows: 
• Enforcing laws and developing, implementing, and enforcing regulations and programs limiting criteria pollutants, 
greenhouse gases, and toxic air contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assessing the 
effectiveness of established procedures. 
• Developing testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuel additives, and testing 
equipment to ensure emission standards are met. 
3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE 
The Stationary Source Program works to reduce emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as 
follows: 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
3900   Air Resources Board - Continued
2021-22 STATE BUDGET — EP 3
* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
• Developing, implementing, and enforcing measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by 
the California Clean Air Act and working with local air pollution control districts to achieve and maintain state and federal 
ambient air quality standards. 
• Identifying substances that are toxic air contaminants and developing, implementing, and enforcing measures to control toxic 
air contaminant emissions from stationary sources. 
3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 40 percent 
below 1990 levels by 2030, as follows: 
• Enforcing laws and developing, implementing, and enforcing regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission 
reductions and other requirements of AB 32 and SB 32. 
• Developing, implementing, and overseeing programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, 
and other incentive programs. 
3515 - SUBVENTION 
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air pollution control districts to encourage and support effective district 
programs. The state's 35 local air pollution control districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary sources of air 
pollution in California. 
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM 
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing 
competitive funding to advance implementation of zero/near-zero emission warehouses and technology. The intent of the 
program is to develop state-of-the-art facilities with the lowest possible emissions. 
3530 - THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM 
The Community Air Protection Program works to reduce air pollution in California's most burdened communities by identifying 
priority communities most burdened by cumulative air pollution impacts and by developing and implementing: 
• Community emission reduction and community monitoring programs. 
• A technology clearinghouse. 
• A statewide uniform system of annual emissions reporting.

INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW 
The Air Resources Board has 58 sites statewide. One site is state-owned and the remaining 57 sites are occupied through 
lease, permit, or license agreements. Of the non state-owned sites, 35 support air-monitoring stations and 22 sites support an 
array of vehicle testing, research, planning, enforcement, chemical laboratory, support services, and administrative needs; 
some of the support sites are also equipped with an air-monitoring station. These sites serve a multitude of programs the Air 
Resources Board oversees to support its statutory authority to attain and maintain healthy air quality, reduce the public's 
exposure to toxic air pollutants, conduct research into the causes of and solutions to air pollution, and support the Air 
Resources Board leadership role related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.
