6870   Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges 
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges was established in 1967 to provide statewide leadership to 
California's 73 community college districts, which operate 116 community colleges. The Board has 18 voting members as 
specified in statute. Twelve members are appointed by the Governor, require Senate approval for six-year terms, and must 
include two current or former local board members. Five members are appointed by the Governor to two-year terms and 
include two students, two faculty members, and one classified member. The Lieutenant Governor also serves as a member of 
the Board. 
The objectives of the Board are to: 
• Provide direction and coordination to California's community colleges. 
• Apportion state funds to districts and ensure prudent use of public resources. 
• Improve district and campus programs through informational and technical services on a statewide basis. 
Because community college programs drive the need for infrastructure investment, each community college district has a 
related capital outlay program to support this need. For specifics on the community college capital outlay program, see 
"Infrastructure Overview."
