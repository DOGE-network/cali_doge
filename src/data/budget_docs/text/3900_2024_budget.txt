3900   State Air Resources Board 
The Air Resources Board has primary responsibility for protecting air quality in California. This responsibility includes 
establishing ambient air quality standards for specific pollutants, maintaining a statewide ambient air-monitoring network in 
conjunction with local air districts, administering air pollution research studies, evaluating standards adopted by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, and developing and implementing plans to attain and maintain these standards. These plans 
include emission limitations for vehicular and other mobile sources, fuels, consumer products, and industrial sources 
established by the Board and local air districts. The Air Resources Board also has the responsibility to develop measures to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, pursuant to Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006 
(AB 32), Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016 (SB 32), and Chapter 337, Statutes of 2022 (AB 1279). The Air Resources Board 
oversees an extensive portfolio of incentives intended to reduce air pollution (including greenhouse gases), support shifts 
towards less-polluting transportation options, and advance zero emission technologies, among other purposes. The Air 
Resources Board is also responsible for developing guidance for agencies administering California Climate Investments 
programs to ensure statutory requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund are met, including maximizing benefits for 
disadvantaged communities, reporting, and quantification methods, pursuant to Chapter 36, Statutes of 2014 (SB 862), and 
serves as the account administrator for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Air Resources Board also implements the 
Community Air Protection Program to reduce air pollution in the State's most burdened communities, pursuant to Chapter 136, 
Statutes of 2017 (AB 617). The Air Resources Board works with local air districts, the business community, scientists, 
community representatives, and other stakeholders to implement its programs. 
Because the Air Resources Board's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Board has a capital outlay 
program to support this need. For the specifics on the Board's capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3500 - MOBILE SOURCE 
The Mobile Source Program works to improve air quality by reducing emissions from on- and off-road mobile sources as 
follows: 
• Developing, implementing, and enforcing laws, regulations, and programs limiting criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and 
toxic air contaminants from new and in-use vehicles and other mobile sources and assessing the effectiveness of 
established procedures. 
• Developing testing and evaluation procedures for vehicles, engines, emission control components, fuels and fuel additives, 
and testing equipment to ensure emission standards are met. 
• Overseeing incentive programs that provide funding to replace existing vehicles and engines, purchase new vehicles and 
engines, plan and implement improved transportation projects, otherwise upgrade or replace air pollution sources, and 
advance zero emission technologies 
3505 - STATIONARY SOURCE 
The Stationary Source Program works to reduce emissions from stationary sources to comply with state and federal laws as 
follows: 
• Developing, implementing, and enforcing measures for reducing emissions from stationary and other sources as required by 
the California Clean Air Act and working with local air districts to achieve and maintain state and federal ambient air quality 
standards. 
• Identifying substances that are toxic air contaminants and developing, implementing, and enforcing measures to control toxic 
air contaminant emissions from stationary sources. 
3510 - CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Climate Change Program works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, as 
follows: 
• Enforcing laws and developing, implementing, and enforcing regulations to achieve the required greenhouse gas emission 
reductions and other requirements of AB 32, SB 32, and AB 1279. 
• Developing, implementing, and overseeing programs to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions, including grant, loan, 
and other incentive programs. 
3515 - SUBVENTION 
The Air Resources Board provides subventions to local air districts to encourage and support effective district programs. The 
state's 35 local air districts have primary responsibility for controlling stationary sources of air pollution in California. 
3525 - THE ZERO/NEAR-ZERO EMISSION WAREHOUSE PROGRAM 
The Zero/Near-Zero Emission Warehouse Program works to reduce emissions from freight-related sources by providing

competitive funding to advance implementation of zero/near-zero emission warehouses and technology. The intent of the 
program is to develop state-of-the-art facilities with the lowest possible emissions. 
3530 - THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM 
The Community Air Protection Program works to reduce air pollution in California's most burdened communities by identifying 
priority communities most burdened by cumulative air pollution impacts and by developing and implementing: 
• Community emission reduction and community monitoring programs. 
• A technology clearinghouse. 
• A statewide uniform system of annual emissions reporting. 
• Community Air Grants.
