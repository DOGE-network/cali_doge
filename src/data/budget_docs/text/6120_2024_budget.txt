distribution of state and federal publications to libraries. 
The Braille and Talking Book Library, a regional library designated by the Library of Congress National Library Service for the 
Blind and Print Disabled, provides Braille and recorded books (digital cartridges and downloadable files) and special playback 
equipment to blind and print-disabled residents of Northern California who are unable to use standard print materials. 
The Bernard E. Witkin State Law Library contains primary and secondary sources in American law, federal and state appellate
