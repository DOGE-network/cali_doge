4170   California Department of Aging 
The Department of Aging's mission is to transform aging for individuals, families, and communities by leading innovative 
programs, planning, policies, and partnerships that increase choices, equity, and well-being for all Californians as we age. The 
population served includes older adults, people with disabilities, and family caregivers. 
As the federally designated State Unit on Aging, the California Department of Aging (CDA) administers federal Older 
Americans Act programs that provide a wide variety of home and community-based supportive services through contracts with 
a statewide network of 33 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) and the 11 statewide Caregiver Resource Centers (CRCs). The 
Department also administers two Medi-Cal programs; it contracts directly with agencies that operate 37 Multipurpose Senior 
Services Program (MSSP) sites and certifies 289 Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS) centers for participation in Medi-
Cal.  In addition, the Department oversees implementation of the Governor’s Master Plan for Aging and California’s efforts to 
build a No Wrong Door system centered in the development of the Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC) program 
to provide person centered counseling and support to older adults, people with disabilities, and family caregivers. CDA 
administers the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP) that provides individualized counseling to 
Medicare beneficiaries, and houses the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program with oversight for the rights of residents in 
long-term care facilities.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
3890 - NUTRITION 
The Nutrition Program provides nutritionally balanced meals, nutrition education, and nutrition counseling to individuals 60 
years of age or older. In addition to promoting better health through improved nutrition, the program focuses on reducing the 
isolation of the elderly and providing a link to other social and supportive services such as transportation, information and 
assistance, employment, and education. 
3895 - SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICE 
The federal Senior Community Service Employment Program, Title V of the Older Americans Act, provides part-time subsidized 
training and employment in community service agencies for low-income persons 55 years of age and older. The program also 
promotes transition to unsubsidized employment. 
3900 - SUPPORTIVE SERVICES 
This program provides supportive services in the community to adults 60 years of age or older, their family caregivers, 
grandparents caring for grandchildren, and residents of long-term care facilities. Services include information and assistance, 
legal assistance, transportation, respite in-home support, senior center activities, elder abuse prevention, and the Long-Term 
Care Ombudsman. Older Americans Act Titles III and VII fund these services to enable individuals to access the support 
necessary for them to remain independent in their communities, continue in their caregiving role, and/or receive long-term care 
services appropriate to their needs. 
CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS 
This program provides support and resources to family caregivers of adults affected by chronic and debilitating health 
conditions, degenerative diseases, or traumatic brain injuries and adults 60 years and older in need of assistance with daily

living activities such as, bathing, eating, or getting dressed.? There are 11 nonprofit Caregiver Resource Centers that provide 
services in each county. 
3905 - COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS 
This program includes the community-based Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP). HICAP provides 
personalized counseling, community education, and outreach events for Medicare beneficiaries. HICAP is the primary local 
source for accurate and objective information and assistance with Medicare benefits, prescription drug plans, and health plans. 
3910 - MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS 
This program includes oversight of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) and Community-Based Adult Services 
(CBAS) program. Under a 1915(c) Medicaid home and community-based services waiver, MSSP provides health and social 
care management to prevent premature and unnecessary long-term care institutionalization of frail adults aged 65 or older who 
otherwise would be placed in a nursing facility. CBAS is a community-based day health program that provides services to 
adults 18 years of age or over who are at risk of needing institutional care due to chronic medical, cognitive, or mental health 
conditions and/or disabilities. The Department certifies CBAS centers for participation in the Medi-Cal Program. 
3915 - POLICY AND PLANNING 
This program is responsible for Aging policy research, analysis, and development for the State’s Aging programs. The program 
specifically addresses policy and planning related to inclusion and isolation prevention, equity-in-aging, housing and livable 
communities, and health in the home and community.
