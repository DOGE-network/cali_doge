8570   Department of Food and Agriculture 
The California Department of Food and Agriculture serves the citizens of California by promoting and protecting a safe, healthy 
food supply; and enhancing local and global agricultural trade, through efficient management, innovation, and sound science, 
with a commitment to environmental stewardship. 
The goals of the California Department of Food and Agriculture are to: 
• Promote and protect the diverse local and global marketability of the California agricultural brand, which represents superior 
quality, value, and safety. 
• Optimize fiscal resources through collaboration, innovation, and process improvements. 
• Connect rural and urban communities by supporting and participating in educational programs that emphasize a mutual 
appreciation of the value of diverse food and agricultural production systems. 
• Improve regulatory efficiency through proactive coordination with stakeholders. 
• Invest in employee development and succession planning efforts. 
Because the California Department of Food and Agriculture's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the 
Department has a capital outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see 
"Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
6570 - AGRICULTURAL PLANT AND ANIMAL HEALTH; PEST PREVENTION; FOOD SAFETY SERVICES 
The objective of this program is to prevent the introduction and establishment of serious plant and animal pests and diseases to 
California, promote judicious antimicrobial use and stewardship and protect the safety of California's dairy, eggs and meat 
products that are exempt from federal inspection. In particular, the program is focused on pests and diseases that can: (1) be 
transmitted to humans, (2) inflict catastrophic financial loss on California's farmers, ranchers, and associated businesses, 
(3) have severe negative impacts on the environment, or (4) adversely affect the supply of agricultural products to the 
consumer. 
6575 - MARKETING; COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES 
California agriculture produces over 400 different crops, which enter state, national, and international commerce. The 
objectives of this program are to assure orderly domestic and international marketing of safe and quality agricultural 
commodities, promote consumer protection, increase food access, ensure fair pricing practices, oversee industry-supported 
grading services, and maintain standards of measurement which provide a basis of value comparison, fair competition in the 
marketplace, and establish quality standards for conventional and alternative fuels and automotive products.

* Dollars in thousands, except in Salary Range. Numbers may not add or match to other statements due to rounding of budget details.
Additionally, this program provides support to governmental agencies that work to protect the nation's food supply and the 
environment by monitoring for chemical contaminants. 
6580 - ASSISTANCE TO FAIRS AND COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
This program provides fiscal and policy oversight to the network of California fairs. 
The State has a network of 79 fairs including county fairs, citrus fruit fairs, District Agricultural Associations and the California 
State Fair (an independent state agency). State oversight of these local fairs includes attendance of board meetings and 
periodic financial reviews and audits. 
6590 - GENERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES 
 
This program provides fiscal and policy oversight for federal grants that promote California agriculture, and for CDFA 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program activities that are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture. 
In addition, this program serves as the central point of contact for logistical coordination of all departmental resources, provides 
industry and agency coordination on environmental issues affecting agriculture, and provides centralized communications to 
California's agricultural industry, including County Agricultural Commissioners and the statewide fairgrounds. 
This program also partially reimburses County Agricultural Commissioners' Offices for carrying out agricultural programs 
authorized by the Food and Agricultural Code under the supervision of CDFA. 
9900 - EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES 
Executive and Management Services include the executive leadership of the Secretary's Office. The Secretary's Office sets 
priorities and policies to protect, support, and promote agriculture in the State of California, and helps to protect the health and 
welfare of the public and the environment. 
Administrative Services provides centralized administrative support to the Department through fiscal operations, employee-
employer relations, personnel management, employee development, and general business services.
