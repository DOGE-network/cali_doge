7120   California Workforce Development Board 
The California Workforce Development Board collaborates with both state and local partners to establish and continuously 
improve the state workforce system, with an emphasis on California's economic vitality and growth. The Board also provides 
leadership for a unified state plan that works in partnership with other state entities such as the Health and Human Services 
Agency, the Department of Social Services, the Department of Rehabilitation, the Community Colleges, and the Department of 
Education. The workforce system is comprised of state and local programs and services that prepare current and future 
workers to meet the ever-evolving needs of California's businesses and industries. These services include: matching job 
seekers with career opportunities and jobs; supplying high-skill workers to business and industry; providing labor market and 
economic information necessary for state, local, and regional planning; preparing youth for advanced learning and careers; and 
encouraging the inclusion of special populations as critical elements of the workforce.
