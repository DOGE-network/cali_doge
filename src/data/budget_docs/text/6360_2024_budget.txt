5381 - PREPARATION AND LICENSING OF TEACHERS 
This program is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and teaching performance in California to ensure 
a quality teaching workforce for California's K-12 students. 
The Certification Division is responsible for evaluating and processing approximately 280,000 applications annually for 
credentials, permits, certificates, and waivers for authorization to serve in California's public schools. The Division serves as the 
primary point of contact for the Commission, providing information to credential applicants and holders and credential 
personnel at the college, university, county, and school district level regarding specific requirements for the licenses issued. 
The Professional Services Division is responsible for: (1) the development of licensure standards for all credential areas, 
aligned with the adopted K-12 content standards, (2) the development and implementation of licensing examinations, including 
the teaching performance assessment, as required in the Education Code, (3) supporting the Commission with analysis and 
development of policy, and (4) administration of state-funded teacher preparation grant programs. The Division supports the 
Committee on Accreditation, a statutory body that is charged with implementing the Commission's accreditation system to 
monitor the quality of all educator preparation programs. The accreditation system involves educators in the evaluation of 
program quality through biennial reports, program review, and site visit activities. Related activities include initial program 
approval, data collection, reporting, and policy research. The Division is also responsible for monitoring certificated 
assignments in collaboration with county offices of education. 
The Division of Professional Practices is responsible for the discipline of credential applicants and holders, and provides legal 
advice to the Commission, the Committee of Credentials, and the Commission's management team. The Committee of 
Credentials is a statutory body that is responsible for investigations of alleged misconduct against credential holders and 
applicants. The investigations generally originate from information provided by employing school districts, on misconduct 
disclosed on an application, and as a result of criminal convictions. 
5382 - ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL SERVICES 
This program provides funding for the Office of the Attorney General to represent the Commission in credential holder discipline 
cases as they progress through the administrative hearing process. 
5383 - ACCREDITATION STREAMLINE PROJECT 
The Accreditation Streamline Project provides a publicly accessible data warehouse containing information about teacher 
preparation programs and educator candidates through a user friendly visualization interface. 
5384 - EDUCATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS 
This program supports development and implementation of Performance Assessments for credential candidates in preparation 
programs that lead to a teaching or administrative services credential.  In addition to ensuring that credential candidates are 
prepared to enter the teaching profession or serve as a school administrator, candidate scores from these assessments will be 
included in the accreditation system for program quality assessment. 
5388 - CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING GRANT PROGRAM 
This program provides grants to K-12 local educational agencies to support recruitment of non-certificated school employees to 
participate in a teacher preparation program and become certificated classroom teachers in California public schools. 
5397 - EDUCATOR PREPARATION 
Provides funding for competitive grants to local educational agencies to recruit, prepare, and retain credentialed K-12 
educators. 
5399 - ADMINISTRATION 
The objective of the Administration program is to provide overall management, planning, policy development, and internal 
administrative support services.
