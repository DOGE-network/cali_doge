PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
2380 - REGULATORY and PLANNING PROGRAM 
 
The Regulatory and Planning program facilitates markets in providing adequate statewide energy supplies. The program 
certifies power plant sites, develops and implements landscape-scale plans to identify suitable areas for renewable energy 
resources and infrastructure development, designates transmission line corridors, and monitors new energy facilities and fuel 
infrastructure for compliance and supply and distribution adequacy, consistent with state energy policies. The program 
develops state energy policy based on the economic, security, safety, and environmental land-use and climate implications of 
energy supply and demand. The Energy Assessments program develops long-range projections for future energy supplies and 
demand, maintains current information on statewide electrical generation sources, consumption and peak demand, natural gas, 
transportation fuels, and distributed generation. The program develops state energy policy based on the economic, financial, 
security, safety, and environmental implications of supply, demand, and price/cost assessments, and monitors energy markets 
for competitive prices and potential market abuses. 
2380010 - Power Plant Site Certification and Transmission Line Corridor Designation Program 
The Power Plant Site Certification and Transmission Line Corridor Designation programs are responsible for the following: 
reviewing thermal power plant siting applications 50 megawatts and larger; ensuring power plant owners, operators, and 
developers comply with their specific conditions of certification and all applicable laws and regulations when constructing, 
operating, and closing power plants, and investigating potential violations; reviewing project change petitions to amend filed 
applications; reviewing applications for transmission line corridor designation; developing environmental and land use 
information and evaluating constraints and opportunities for renewable energy infrastructure development; and analyzing 
safety, reliability, efficiency, resilience, and environmental performance issues related to power plants and the state electricity 
transmission grid. 
2380019 - Electricity Analysis 
The Electricity Analysis program is responsible for evaluating current and future electricity supply market trends and 
infrastructure needs; estimating costs and emissions of various generation types; assessing the adequacy of electricity 
supplies; and analyzing regulations and environmental issues related to electricity. Additionally, this program addresses the

distribution system and its relationship to distributed generation, including planning and interconnection barriers and provides 
information and recommendations to state agencies, electricity market participants, and the public. The natural gas program 
component is responsible for evaluating current and future natural gas market trends and infrastructure needs, assessing the 
adequacy of natural gas supplies, monitoring the interaction of natural gas and electricity to maintain system reliability, 
analyzing regulations and environmental issues related to natural gas, and leading interagency work groups to monitor short-
term natural gas market trends. The program also collects, monitors, and analyzes data on transportation fuel supply and 
production, fuel infrastructure issues, and responds to energy and fuel shortages and emergencies. 
2385 - ENERGY RESOURCES CONSERVATION PROGRAM 
 
The Energy Resources Conservation program objectives include reducing overall energy use and decreasing peak electricity 
demand by identifying energy efficiency opportunities and developing and implementing programs and standards for efficiently 
using energy in all sectors. 
2385010 - Building and Appliances Program 
The Building and Appliances program objectives include reducing consumer and business energy use, water use, and peak 
demand by developing and implementing strategies and minimum efficiency and flexible demand standards for appliances, 
equipment, and new and existing residential and nonresidential buildings. The Building and Appliances program provides 
technical assistance on building standards and enforcement support to the building industry and building departments. Further, 
the program maintains a database of efficient appliances and equipment and enforces compliance with the appliance efficiency 
standards. 
2385019 - Energy Projects Evaluation and Assistance Program 
This program is responsible for providing technical assistance, grants, and loans to improve energy efficiency and reduce 
operating costs of schools, colleges, local jurisdictions, hospitals, and public care facilities. 
2385028 - Demand Analysis 
The Demand Analysis program is responsible for collecting and analyzing electricity and natural gas consumption data used to 
prepare energy demand forecasts, forecasting peak and total energy consumption by sector, and estimating the amount of 
energy conserved by existing and proposed program activities. The program conducts detailed electricity and natural gas end-
use surveys which serve as a primary data source for energy demand forecasts, conservation potential studies, and market 
and policy impact assessments. The program also performs transportation energy demand forecasting, conducts consumer 
vehicle choice surveys, and assesses the impacts of transportation electrification on California electricity use. 
2390 - DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
The Development Program focuses on transportation and alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. The mission is to support 
provision of adequate and reliable transportation energy to the California transportation sector while balancing economic, public 
health, safety, and environmental consequences. The program also conducts research, development, demonstration, 
commercialization, and deployment activities on energy efficiency, renewable and advanced energy technologies, and 
alternative and renewable fuel and advanced vehicle technologies so that future energy supplies are: cost effective, secure, 
and reliable; enhance environmental quality; and promote state and local economic development. The program provides 
technical assistance, financial assistance, direct technology research and demonstration, technology forecasting, technology 
analysis and evaluation, and knowledge sharing. 
2390010 - Transportation Technology and Fuels 
The Clean Transportation Program provides financial incentives to develop and deploy innovative technologies, infrastructure, 
and strategies that transform California's fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state's climate change and public health 
policies. The program goal is the development, deployment and integration of zero and near-zero emission fuels and advanced 
vehicle technologies and infrastructure. The program provides analyses and recommendations to guide state energy policy and 
legislation to achieve climate change and air quality objectives, reduce petroleum consumption, and promote economic 
development. The program also provides incentives to workforce development, training, and manufacturing that supports the 
program goals. 
2390019 - Research and Development 
The Research and Development program spurs innovation in energy efficiency, energy generation, storage, infrastructure 
resiliency, renewable integration, and transportation to meet the state’s clean energy and climate goals. The programs bring 
science and technology breakthroughs from the lab to the market to benefit all Californians, with a focus on ensuring the 
benefits also accrue to under-resourced communities. The programs catalyze a world-class innovation ecosystem that provides 
the resources, expertise, and information to foster and support successful clean energy entrepreneurship across the state. The 
programs equip communities, businesses, and public agencies with breakthrough technology solutions and tools to build a 
safe, resilient, affordable and clean energy system. The programs are administered through strategic performance-based 
competitive solicitations.
