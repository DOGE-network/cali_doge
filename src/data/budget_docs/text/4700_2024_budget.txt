PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
4181 - ENERGY PROGRAMS 
The Energy Programs assist low-income households in meeting their immediate and long-term home energy needs through 
financial assistance, energy conservation, weatherization, and renewable energy services. 
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides financial assistance to eligible low-income households 
to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residential dwellings, assistance for weather-related or energy-related 
emergencies, and weatherization services to improve the energy efficiency of low-income residential dwellings and safeguard 
the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program provides weatherization to improve the energy efficiency of low-
income residential dwellings and safeguard the health and safety of household occupants. 
The Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) provides energy efficiency and renewable energy services in low-income 
single-family farmworker and multi-family dwellings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs. LIWP 
projects include weatherization and solar photovoltaic system installations. 
4185 - COMMUNITY SERVICES 
The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is designed to enable local government and nonprofit community organizations 
to help low-income families achieve and maintain economic security through a broad range of activities. These activities include 
education, employment services, emergency services, housing, income support and management, and health and nutritional 
services, among others. 
The California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) benefits low-income, working Californians by providing cash-back tax 
credits to boost the income of eligible individuals and families. Since 2017-18, the Department has worked with the Franchise 
Tax Board to provide grant opportunities for community-based organizations to increase awareness of CalEITC and free tax 
preparation assistance programs.
