8820   Commission on the Status of Women and Girls 
The California Commission on the Status of Women and Girls is the leading state agency advancing the interests of women 
and girls in one of the world's largest economies and the most populous state in the nation. We work inclusively to champion 
issues impacting women and girls through advocacy, education, and outreach to the Governor, Legislature, other public 
policymakers, and the public to attain equity and access for all. The 17 member Commission includes three State Senators, 
three Assemblymembers, the State Labor Commissioner, and ten appointed public members (seven by the Governor, one by 
the Superintendent of Public Instruction, one by the Senate Committee on Rules and one by the Assembly Speaker).
