6100   Department of Education 
California's public education system is administered at the state level by the Department of Education, under the direction of 
the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the education of approximately 6 million 
students. Administrative branches of the Department include the Executive Branch; the Operations and Administration Branch; 
the Opportunities for All Branch; the Student Achievement Branch; the Student Support Services Branch; the Information and 
Technology Branch; the Instruction, Measurement and Administration Branch; and the Legal, Audits and Charters Branch. 
The primary duties of the Superintendent and the Department are to administer TK-12 education programs, to provide technical 
assistance to local school districts and offices of education and to work with the educational community to improve academic 
performance. Major goals of the Department include: (a) holding local agencies accountable for student achievement in all 
programs and for all groups of students, (b) building local capacity in utilizing a process of continual improvement that enables 
all students to achieve to state standards, (c) expanding and improving a system of recruiting, developing, and supporting 
teachers that instills excellence in every classroom, preschool through adult, (d) providing statewide leadership that promotes 
effective use of technology to improve teaching and learning, (e) increasing efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of 
TK-12 education, including student record keeping and good financial management practices, (f) providing broader and more 
effective communication among the home, school, district, county, and state, (g) establishing and fostering systems of school, 
home, and community resources that provide the physical, emotional, and intellectual support to help students succeed, (h) 
advocating for additional resources and additional flexibility, (i) providing statewide leadership that promotes good business 
practices so that California schools can target their resources to serve students, and (j) improving the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Department. 
Because the Department of Education's programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, the Department has a capital 
outlay program to support this need. For the specifics on the Department's capital outlay program see "Infrastructure 
Overview."

Provides oversight, support, educational training, technical assistance, meal reimbursement, and funding and grant 
opportunities to participating public and private schools, county offices of education and camps to increase access and serve 
nutritious meals that meet specific federal standards. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) funds the 
reimbursement for local child nutrition program sponsors that serve nutritious meals to children participating in the National 
School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program, Special Milk Program, Summer Food Service Program, After 
School Meals Supplements Program under the NSLP, and Seamless Summer Feeding Option. Collectively the child nutrition 
programs serve over 885 million meals and snacks annually. There is also state funded reimbursement for schools to comply 
with the state meal mandate in Education Code Section 49550 which now includes making available a breakfast and lunch 
each school day to all public-school students. 
 
Food Distribution: 
Administers the USDA Foods program by offering over 140 minimally processed, domestic fresh, frozen and shelf-stable foods 
to eligible child nutrition programs to use in preparing meals in their programs. USDA Foods are received and stored at two 
food distribution centers and delivered to over 1,100 child nutrition operators throughout California. 
5220 - STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 
The State Board of Education sets K-12 education policy in the areas of standards, instructional materials, assessment, and 
accountability. 
5240 - STATE-MANDATED LOCAL PROGRAMS 
This program provides funding, pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, to reimburse local entities for 
costs they incur in complying with certain state-mandated education programs.
