0690   Office of Emergency Services 
The principal objective of the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is to protect lives and property, build emergency 
response capabilities, and support communities for a resilient California. The Cal OES Director serves as both the Governor's 
Homeland Security Advisor and Emergency Management Director, with responsibility to implement and facilitate the state's 
homeland security and counter-terrorism strategy. Cal OES serves the public through effective collaboration in preparing for, 
protecting against, responding to, recovering from, and mitigating the impacts of hazards and threats. 
Cal OES provides leadership, assistance, training, and support to state and local agencies and coordinates with federal 
agencies in planning and preparing for the most effective use of federal, state, local, and private sector resources in 
emergencies. This emergency planning is based upon a system of mutual aid whereby a jurisdiction relies first on its own 
resources, and then requests assistance from its neighbors. Cal OES' plans and programs are coordinated with those of the 
federal government, other states, private sector, utilities, and state and local agencies within California. 
During an emergency, Cal OES functions as the Governor's immediate staff to provide guidance and coordinate the state's 
responsibilities under the Emergency Services Act and applicable federal statutes. It also acts as the conduit for federal 
assistance through natural disaster grants and federal agency support. Additionally, Cal OES is responsible for the 
development and coordination of a comprehensive state strategy related to all hazards, including terrorism, which includes 
prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. 
Cal OES implements the state's homeland security strategy by overseeing the California Cybersecurity Integration Center and 
the State Threat Assessment System (STAS), which includes management of the State Threat Assessment Center. The STAS 
assists in the detection, prevention, and investigation of and response to criminal and terrorist activity and also facilitates 
information and intelligence sharing between local, state, federal, tribal agencies, and private sector partners. 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission is a separate unit within the Office of Emergency Services. Its mission is to 
lower earthquake risk to life and property of Californians. The Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well 
as the private sector, on a variety of activities that guide and stimulate earthquake risk reduction and management. 
Because Cal OES' programs drive a need for infrastructure investment, Cal OES has a capital outlay program to support this 
need. For the specifics on Cal OES' capital outlay program, see "Infrastructure Overview."

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS 
0380 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
 
Working through the state's mutual aid system, the Emergency Management Services and Homeland Security Program 
coordinates the provision of federal, state, and local resources to jurisdictions whose resources and services are overextended 
in a disaster situation. In addition, this program develops and coordinates a comprehensive state strategy related to an all-
hazards approach that includes prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery consistent with the National 
Strategy on Homeland Security. Central to this effort is maintaining operational readiness at all levels of government. Within this 
program, Cal OES also trains emergency managers, responders, and state and local leaders in preparedness and response to 
all hazards. 
0385 - SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND GRANT MANAGEMENT 
Cal OES serves as the State Administering Agent for federal homeland security, emergency management, and victim services 
grants and is the primary liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Department of Homeland 
Security, and other federal agencies. Additionally, Cal OES serves as an advocate for local public safety, emergency 
management, and public and private agencies operating public safety and victim service programs. As part of its grant 
management role, Cal OES administers the California Disaster Assistance Act and provides eligible local agencies with 
financial assistance to recover from disasters. Included in this program is the State Threat Assessment Center, which is the 
centerpiece of the state's intelligence information sharing environment and serves as the Governor's designated primary fusion 
center. 
0390 - ALFRED E. ALQUIST SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION 
The Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission program provides a coordinated framework for establishing consistent 
earthquake policies; advising the Governor, the Legislature, local governments, and the public; and tracking the state’s 
progress toward higher levels of seismic safety.  The Commission uses the expertise of its commissioners to review, evaluate, 
and translate scientific information and make recommendations to guide and influence earthquake safety policies.  The 
Commission works with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector, on a variety of activities that support 
the state’s earthquake preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts.  These activities include: (1) developing and 
reviewing seismic safety projects; (2) providing consistent policy direction; (3) proposing and reviewing earthquake-related 
legislation; (4) conducting public hearings on seismic safety issues; (5) using existing knowledge and conducting studies, 
where necessary, to improve the performance of structures in California, (6) recommending earthquake safety programs and 
supporting cost-effective partnerships that help reduce earthquake risks and speed economic recovery. 
0395 - PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS 
The Public Safety Communications program is responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and repair of the 
state's public safety communications networks and oversight of the state's 9-1-1 system. The program is dedicated to the 
preservation and protection of human life and public safety by delivering reliable and dependable communication services that 
keep the public connected during times of crisis. 
9900 - ADMINISTRATION AND EXECUTIVE 
The Administration and Executive Program provides the overall policy direction of Cal OES and support services such as 
accounting, fiscal, personnel, information technology, and business services.
