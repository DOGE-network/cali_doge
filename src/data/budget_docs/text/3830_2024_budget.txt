of the river extending from Friant Dam to Highway 99, with an interconnected trail system and recreational and educational 
features. 
• Operate and manage lands for public access, recreation, and enjoyment consistent with the protection of natural and cultural 
resources. 
• Protect, enhance, and restore riparian and riverine habitat and ecological diversity. 
• Provide for multi-benefit water quality, water supply, ecosystem and watershed protection and restoration. 
• Facilitate the development of the parkway by assisting other entities in conserving and improving their lands within the 
parkway, and to garner public support to secure its future. 
• Acquire land from willing sellers to facilitate the above activities with a target of 5,900 acres.
