## Major Projects and Initiatives

### Environmental Justice and Tribal Affairs

CalEPA's Environmental Justice and Tribal Affairs program works to ensure the fair treatment of all people regardless of race, culture, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

### Climate Action

The agency coordinates California's climate action efforts, including the implementation of the state's cap-and-trade program, which generates revenue for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to support programs that further reduce emissions.

### Pollution Prevention

CalEPA leads pollution prevention initiatives that focus on reducing or eliminating pollution at the source, rather than controlling it after it has been created, through changes in production, operation, and raw materials use.
