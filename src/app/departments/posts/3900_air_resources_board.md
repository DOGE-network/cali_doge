## Major Projects and Initiatives

### Clean Transportation Incentives

CARB has administered significant clean transportation funding, with approximately $6.3 billion appropriated from FY 2009-10 through FY 2024-25[5]. These funds support two primary programs:

1. **Air Quality Improvement Program (AQIP)**: Funded through the Air Quality Improvement Fund, supporting projects that advance clean vehicle technologies[5].

2. **Low Carbon Transportation Program**: Funded through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and General Fund, supporting zero-emission vehicle markets and providing sustainable transportation options for disadvantaged communities[5].

### Mobile Source Strategy

1. **2016 Mobile Source Strategy**: Established a comprehensive framework for emission reductions from mobile sources[2].

2. **2020 Mobile Source Strategy**: Updated the 2016 strategy in compliance with Senate Bill 44 (2019)[2].

3. **2025 Mobile Source Strategy**: Currently in development, this plan will identify the transition to cleaner mobile source technologies needed to achieve California's air quality and climate targets[2].

### California Climate Investments

Since 2014, CARB has overseen California Climate Investments, which direct Cap-and-Trade auction proceeds to greenhouse gas reduction projects:

1. **Comprehensive Investment Program**: By 2023, these investments implemented nearly $1.7 billion across 89 programs administered by 24 state agencies[19].

2. **Priority Population Benefits**: Programs have consistently invested in disadvantaged communities, low-income communities, and low-income households[19][5].

### Advanced Clean Cars Program

1. **Coordinated Requirements Package**: Established for model years 2015-2025, combining control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gas emissions[3].

2. **Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Program**: Requires manufacturers to produce increasing numbers of ZEVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the 2018-2025 model years[3].

### Southern California Headquarters Development

In 2021, CARB completed its state-of-the-art Mary D. Nichols Campus in Riverside:

1. **Advanced Testing Facility**: Includes specialized laboratories and testing equipment for vehicle emissions research[6].

2. **Sustainable Design**: Built as the largest Zero Net Energy building in the United States at 402,000 square feet, achieving LEED Platinum certification[6].

## Major Regulations

### Transportation Sector Regulations

1. **Advanced Clean Cars Regulations**: Established greenhouse gas standards for 2017-2025 vehicle models, combined NMOG and NOx standards, and increased durability requirements from 120,000 to 150,000 miles[3].

2. **Truck and Bus Regulation**: Implemented in 2008 and strengthened over the past decade, requiring vehicles with GVWR over 26,000 pounds to have 2010 or newer engines as of January 1, 2023[9].

3. **Transport Refrigeration Unit (TRU) Regulation**: Mandates refrigerants with Global Warming Potential less than 2,200 and stricter particulate emission standards for newer models, with a zero-emission transition required by December 31, 2029[9].

4. **Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) Regulation**: Requires truck manufacturers to increase zero-emission vehicle sales starting with the 2024 model year, with escalating percentages (7% in 2025, 10% in 2026, 15% in 2027)[9].

5. **Clean Truck Check Program**: Implements periodic emissions compliance testing for heavy-duty vehicles with GVWR over 14,000 pounds operating in California[9].

### Climate Programs

1. **Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)**: Updated guidance for electricity credit proceeds, requiring spending on equity transportation electrification projects[13].

2. **Compliance Offset Program**: Established protocols for generating offset credits in sectors including livestock, mine methane capture, ozone-depleting substances, rice cultivation, and forestry projects[8].

## Administrative Structure

CARB operates with a governing board of 16 members (14 voting, 2 non-voting) and is organized into 15 divisions and offices[6], including:

1. Office of the Chair
2. Executive Office 
3. Air Quality Planning and Science Division
4. Emission Certification and Compliance Division
5. Enforcement Division
6. Industrial Strategies Division
7. Mobile Source Control Division
8. Research Division
9. Sustainable Transportation and Communities Division

## Funding Allocation Process

1. **Annual Funding Plans**: CARB develops detailed funding plans, such as the Fiscal Year 2024-25 Funding Plan for Clean Transportation Incentives, to determine allocations across various projects[1][5].

2. **Interagency Coordination**: CARB works closely with agencies like the California Energy Commission to ensure vehicle investments are complemented by supporting infrastructure[5].

3. **Priorities**: Investments are designed to target priority populations and maximize benefits to disadvantaged communities[4].
