### Climate Resilience

The agency coordinates the state's climate adaptation strategy, Safeguarding California, which outlines actions to protect communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems from climate impacts such as sea-level rise, extreme heat, and increased wildfire risk.

### Tribal Engagement and Co-Management

The agency is implementing a Tribal Nature-Based Solutions Initiative that supports tribal-led efforts to protect natural and cultural resources, while advancing the state's commitment to tribal co-management of lands and waters.
